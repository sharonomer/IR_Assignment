<p>President Donald Trump briefly spoke to reporters Tuesday to remark on the stock market and little else.</p>
<p>At a hastily announced event in the White House briefing room, Trump celebrated the Dow Jones Industrial Average breaking the 30,000 mark &#x2013; a record.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Thirty thousand, definitely broken that number. That&#x2019;s a sacred number. Thirty thousand. Nobody thought they&#x2019;d ever see it,&#x201D; Trump said.</p>
<p>He continued, &#x201C;I just want to congratulate all the people within the administration that worked so hard. And most importantly, I want to congratulate the people of our country because there are no people like you. Thank you very much, everybody.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Trump again took no questions from reporters &#x2013; he has not taken any since Joe Biden was declared president-elect on November 7. Trump is also still not conceding the election even though the transition to Biden&#x2019;s presidency has officially shifted into gear.</p>
<p>Almost three weeks after Election Day, Trump&#x2019;s administration and the General Services Administration (GSA) <a href="/news/2020/11/24/trump-okays-transition-to-biden-after-michigan-certifies-vote">officially</a> ascertained Biden is the &#x201C;apparent winner&#x201D; and began the presidential transition process, signalling one of the key structural acknowledgements that Trump&#x2019;s time in office is waning.</p>
<p>Trump, however, is insisting the GSA&#x2019;s action is just a formality &#x2013; tweeting Tuesday, &#x201C;the GSA does not determine who the next President of the United States will be.&#x201D;</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">

<p>While technically, Trump is correct &#x2013; the voters determine that &#x2013; virtually every milestone the president has held up as his reasoning to hold off conceding the election has passed without affecting the outcome: The GSA&#x2019;s transition handoff, lawsuits challenging vote counts and ballots, recounts, and individual states&#x2019; election certifications. And as the days go on, more of these milestones continue to be passed.</p>
<h2>Pennsylvania</h2>
<p>Biden has been certified as the winner of the presidential election in Pennsylvania, after three weeks of vote counting and a string of failed Trump-backed legal challenges, state officials said Tuesday.</p>
<p>The Pennsylvania State Department &#x201C;certified the results of the November 3 election in Pennsylvania for president and vice president of the United States,&#x201D; Governor Tom Wolf, a Democrat, tweeted.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Today <a href="https://twitter.com/PAStateDept?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@PAStateDept</a> certified the results of the November 3 election in Pennsylvania for president and vice president of the United States.</p>

<p>Pennsylvania&#x2019;s 20 electors, a mix of elected Democrats, party activists and other staunch Biden backers, will meet in the state Capitol on December 14.</p>
<p>Trump lost the state to Biden by 80,555 votes.</p>
<h2>Wisconsin recount</h2>
<p>Milwaukee County, one of two Wisconsin counties conducting a recount, could complete the recounting of its presidential election results as soon as Wednesday and no later than Friday, a county spokesman said Tuesday.</p>
<p>The recount got off to a slow start last week as elections officials addressed a myriad of complaints from Trump&#x2019;s attorneys and observers. But the work is &#x201C;very close to being back on schedule,&#x201D; said Brian Rothgery, spokesman for the Milwaukee County Board of Supervisors.</p>

<p>Neither county planned to work on Thanksgiving, which is Thursday. They must complete the recount by December 1, the deadline for certifying the vote.</p>
<p>Trump lost to Democrat Joe Biden by about 20,600 votes in Wisconsin but paid for a recount in Milwaukee and Dane counties and is widely expected to file a lawsuit challenging absentee ballots once the recount is complete.</p>
<p>As of Tuesday morning, recounted ballots showed a net gain of only 57 votes for Trump.</p>
