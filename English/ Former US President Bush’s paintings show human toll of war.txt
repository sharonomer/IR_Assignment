<p>In some paintings, the wounds are plain to see: an arm or leg lost to war. In others, the injuries that US veterans suffered are hidden from view.</p>
<p>But all of the works by former president George W Bush &#x2013; painted as a tribute to the men and women he sent to war &#x2013; reflect the human toll of his decisions as commander-in-chief.</p>
<p>Command Sergeant Major Brian Flom was wounded in the face by a rocket attack in Iraq in 2007.</p>
<p>&#x201C;That was the easy part,&#x201D; he said, standing beside a painting in which he appears with fellow military personnel, one of dozens of works on display at the Kennedy Center in Washington, DC.</p>
<p>&#x201C;The challenging part was the TBI [traumatic brain injury] and the post-traumatic stress that accompanied a lot of time spent in a combat zone.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Recovery is &#x201C;still going on &#x2013; it&#x2019;s an everyday process, right, and some days are better than others&#x201D;.</p>
<p>Flom was selected to go on a mountain bike ride with Bush in 2015 and has now met him &#x201C;many times&#x201D;, including dinner at the former president&#x2019;s house.</p>
<p>Bush &#x201C;decided one day to paint people that he had a connection with and meant something to him, and here I am&#x201D;.</p>
<p>&#x201C;It&#x2019;s a huge honour,&#x201D; Flom said.</p>

<p>Bush ordered the US military into Afghanistan following the September 11, 2001 attacks and launched the invasion of Iraq to topple ruler Saddam Hussein in 2003.</p>

<p>More than 3,500 US military personnel have been killed and about 32,000 wounded in hostile action in Iraq, while combat in Afghanistan &#x2013; a war that turned 18 on Monday &#x2013; has left nearly 2,000 dead and more than 20,500 wounded.</p>
<p>Bush, 73, took up painting after leaving office in early 2009 and has sought to help veterans who served in the wars that defined his presidency.</p>
<p>&#x201C;I painted these men and women as a way to honour their service to the country and to show my respect for their sacrifice and courage,&#x201D; Bush said in a quote featured at the exhibition, titled Portraits of Courage: A Commander in Chief&#x2019;s Tribute to America&#x2019;s Warriors.</p>
<h2><strong>&#x2018;Wish it was different&#x2019;</strong>&#xA0;</h2>
<p>&#x201C;Everybody that was painted &#x2026; has participated in one of two events that the president hosts every year with wounded veterans and their families&#x201D; &#x2013;&#xA0; a bike ride and a golf tournament &#x2013; said former US army sergeant first class Michael Rodriguez.</p>
<p>Rodriguez, who is pictured in a standalone portrait by Bush, was deployed nine times during his 21 years in the military and wounded several times, &#x201C;mainly traumatic brain injuries&#x201D; from bomb blasts.</p>
<p>He met Bush during a mountain bike ride in 2014, and was later selected for an advisory council on how to better serve post-9/11 veterans and their families, getting to know him personally.</p>
<p>Rodriguez said he has no anger towards Bush over the wounds he sustained.</p>
<p>&#x201C;During my 21 years of service, I worked for four different presidents. I would never assume to &#x2026; be that arrogant to think I &#x2026; had all the information to make the decisions they made,&#x201D; he said.</p>
<p>He said he has &#x201C;never ever been upset at any of our presidents&#x201D;.</p>

<p>Former US army sergeant DeWitt Osborne is another veteran painted by Bush, like Flom appearing in a montage of military personnel.</p>
<p>He was wounded by a bomb blast near Iraq&#x2019;s capital, Baghdad, in 2006 that injured his right shoulder, right foot, fractured vertebrae and caused a traumatic brain injury as well as post-traumatic stress.</p>
<p>He underwent 21 surgeries, spending four years recovering at the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, in Bethesda, Maryland.</p>
<p>Osborne said he still follows events in Iraq, where the US withdrawal was followed by a rise in violence, an armed takeover of swaths of the country, and years of battles to push rebel fighters back.</p>
<p>Protests have recently erupted in which more than 100 people have been killed over a week.</p>
<p>&#x201C;It&#x2019;s a shame,&#x201D; Osborne said of events there, expressing hope things get better. &#x201C;We as a country [have] shed a lot of blood and tears and work over there.</p>
<p>&#x201C;I wish it was different.&#x201D;</p>
