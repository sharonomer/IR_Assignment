<p style="line-height:150%"><span style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;line-height:150%">&#x201C;Those were better times. There were no thugs on the streets then. Where is that security now?&#x201D; asks Aliya Ali, a homemaker in her sixties.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%"><span style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;line-height:150%">Despite on-going court cases against Mubarak on charges of corruption and of killing protesters during the 2011 revolution, the former autocrat was released from prison recently, to be held under house arrest.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%"><span style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;line-height:150%">Just hours after the news of his release, a Facebook page had sprung up urging Egyptians to support Mubarak for a presidential bid in 2014.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%"><span style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;line-height:150%">A serious presidential run is unlikely, but behind the hyperbole, some analysts say that Egypt&#x2019;s transitional period is seeing a resurgence and rehabilitation of some elements of Mubarak&#x2019;s failed regime. </span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%"><strong><span style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;line-height:150%">Familiar faces in the cabinet</span></strong></p>
<p style="line-height:150%"><span style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;line-height:150%">The key posts in Egypt&#x2019;s transitional cabinet, formed after the ouster of President Mohamed Morsi in July, went to liberal politicians or technocrats. Hazem el-Beblawi, a renowned economist and co-founder of the liberal Egyptian Social Democratic Party, became prime minister. Another party figure, Ziad Bahaa el-Din, took the role of deputy prime minister, while Mohamed ElBaradei was made vice president for external affairs, although he later resigned the post to protest the army&#x2019;s crackdown on pro-Morsi demonstrators.</span></p>

<p style="line-height:150%"><span style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;line-height:150%">The choice of ministers did elicit positive responses from key international players. US Secretary of State John Kerry said of the new lineup: &#x201C;<span style="background:none repeat scroll 0% 0% white">I know a number of them personally, and I know they are extremely competent people.&#x201D;</span></span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%"><span style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;line-height:150%">But in the less high profile roles, some of the jobs went to veteran bureaucrats who had links with the Mubarak regime.</span></p>

<p style="line-height:150%"><span class="apple-converted-space"><span style="background:none repeat scroll 0% 0% white;font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;line-height:150%">Labib provoked considerable opposition during his time as governor of Alexandria in the last years of Mubarak&#x2019;s presidency. </span></span><span style="background:none repeat scroll 0% 0% white;font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;line-height:150%">&#x201C;He was highly unpopular and became synonymous with repression,&#x201D; Ali told Al Jazeera.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%"><span style="background:none repeat scroll 0% 0% white;font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;line-height:150%">Gruesome human rights abuses occurred under Labib&#x2019;s watch, says Ali, including the notorious death of Khaled Said from police torture in 2010. </span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%"><span style="background:none repeat scroll 0% 0% white;font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;line-height:150%">Labib was appointed to a third governorship in 2011, under the rule of the military council, and retained by Morsi on his coming to power, who kept him on despite his unpopularity before sacking him in June. </span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%"><span style="background:none repeat scroll 0% 0% white;font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;line-height:150%">His return represents another key component of Mubarak-era politics that seems to be resurgent &#x2013; the police state. </span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%"><span style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;line-height:150%">Dunne believes that Egypt is seeing &#x201C;an attempt to reconstruct something like the role that the military and the intelligence and the internal services played under Mubarak. During the two and a half years since Mubarak was removed, the internal security services and intelligence were on the retreat, keeping a low profile.&#x201D;</span></p>
<div></div>
<p style="line-height:150%"><span style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;line-height:150%"></span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%"><span style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;line-height:150%">The security services, which were not subjected to needed reform during Morsi&#x2019;s presidency, are now &#x201C;very much resurgent,&#x201D; says Dunne.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%"><span style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;line-height:150%">One example of this resurgence is the appointment, in August, of new provincial governors &#x2013; powerful positions that under Mubarak were largely occupied by retired police or military leaders. Of the 25 governors appointed in the August reshuffle, nineteen were military or police generals, some with chequered histories of dealing with anti-regime protesters both before and after the 2011 revolution.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%"><span style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;line-height:150%">&#x201C;During Morsi&#x2019;s era we saw a lot of Muslim Brotherhood figures appointed to be provincial governors. It&#x2019;s clear that whoever is in power will try to put whomever they trust into those positions,&#x201D; says Dunne.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%"><strong><span style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;line-height:150%">A partial comeback</span></strong></p>
<p style="line-height:150%"><span style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;line-height:150%">Dunne is sceptical as to whether all the elements of the Mubarak political system will make a comeback. The group that gathered around Gamal Mubarak, at one time touted as a vibrant, reformist successor to his father, were &#x201C;not popular with the army.&#x201D;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%"><span style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;line-height:150%">&#x201C;We know that&#x2019;s one of the reasons why the military went along with the 2011 revolution &#x2013; because they were unhappy with Mubarak&#x2019;s succession plan. So I don&#x2019;t expect to necessarily see all the NDP figures come back, but I would expect to see some of them. Some of them could make themselves useful to the military and security services, and we&#x2019;ll see some of them coming back into ministerial positions.&#x201D;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%"><span style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;line-height:150%">Sallam argues that the government is not the only place where &#x201C;Mubarakism&#x201D; is gaining ground. </span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%"><span style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;line-height:150%">&#x201C;People like [newspaper owner] Ibrahim Eissa are now comfortable scolding activists for objecting to Mubarak&#x2019;s release from prison, and private newspapers that were once home to progressive, revolutionary voices that opposed the Mubarak regime and its return are now providing prominent space to voices supportive of the police state.&#x201D;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%"><span style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;line-height:150%">Back on the streets of Cairo, businessman Ahmed El-Naggar says he probably wouldn&#x2019;t vote for Mubarak in a future presidential poll, but he has no objection to seeing prominent figures from Mubarak-era politics back in power.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%"><span style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;line-height:150%">&#x201C;I remember [former prime minister Ahmed] Nazif. He made some good changes to the economy. Egypt was really moving ahead then; international companies wanted to come here and invest. I think if we see these kind of experienced figures come back onto the scene, that&#x2019;s a good thing.&#x201D;</span></p>
