<p>The five-page transcript of a conversation between Bush and British Prime Minister Tony Blair reveals that Blair talked Bush out of launching a military strike on the station, unnamed sources told the <a href="http://www.mirror.co.uk" target="_blank">daily</a>.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The transcript of the pair&#x2019;s talks during Blair&#x2019;s 16 April 2004 visit to Washington allegedly shows Bush wanted to attack the satellite channel&#x2019;s headquarters in Doha, Qatar.</p>
<p>Blair allegedly feared such a strike, in the capital of Qatar, a key Western ally in the Gulf, would spark revenge attacks.</p>
<p>Aljazeera has said in a news statement that it is investigating the report and urged the US and British governments to challenge it.</p>
<p></p>
<p>A British civil servant has been charged under the Official Secrets Act for allegedly leaking the government memo.</p>
<p><strong>Civil servant accused</strong></p>
<p>Cabinet Office civil servant David Keogh is accused of passing the memo to Leo O&#x2019;Connor, who formerly worked for former British lawmaker Tony Clarke.</p>
<p>Both Keogh and O&#x2019;Connor are scheduled to appear at London&#x2019;s Bow Street Magistrates Court next week.</p>

<p>According to the Daily Mirror, Clarke returned the memo to Blair&#x2019;s office. Clarke could not immediately be contacted for comment on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The Mirror on Tuesday quoted an unnamed British government official as saying Bush&#x2019;s threat was &#x201C;humorous, not serious&#x201D;.</p>
<p>Aljazeera&#x2019;s&#xA0;coverage of the war in Iraq had drawn criticism from Washington after the US-led March 2003 invasion.</p>
<p>A source told the Mirror: &#x201C;The memo is explosive and hugely damaging to Bush.</p>
<p><br>
</p>
<p>&#x201C;He made clear he wanted to bomb Aljazeera in Qatar and elsewhere. Blair replied that would cause a big problem.</p>
<p>&#x201C;There&#x2019;s no doubt what Bush wanted to do &#x2013; and no doubt Blair didn&#x2019;t want him to do it.&#x201D;</p>
<p><strong>Deadly serious</strong></p>
<p>Another source said: &#x201C;Bush was deadly serious, as was Blair. That much is absolutely clear from the language used by both men.&#x201D;</p>
<p>A spokesman for Blair&#x2019;s Downing Street office said: &#x201C;We have got nothing to say about this story. We don&#x2019;t comment on leaked documents.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Clarke, the former lawmaker, told Britain&#x2019;s domestic Press Association news agency that O&#x2019;Connor had done &#x201C;exactly the right thing&#x201D; in bringing it to his attention.</p>
<p>The Mirror said such a strike would have been &#x201C;the most spectacular foreign-policy disaster since the Iraq war itself&#x201D;.</p>
<p>The newspaper said that the memo &#x201C;casts fresh doubt on claims that other attacks on Aljazeera were accidents&#x201D;. It cited the 2001 direct hit on the channel&#x2019;s&#xA0;Kabul office in Afghanistan.</p>
<p>In April 2003, an Aljazeera journalist died when its Baghdad office was struck during a US bombing campaign. Nabil Khoury, a US State Department spokesman in Doha, said the strike was a mistake.</p>
<p>In November 2002, Aljazeera&#x2019;s office in Kabul, Afghanistan, was destroyed by a US missile. None of the crew was at the office at the time. US officials said they believed the target was a terrorist site and did not know it was Aljazeera&#x2019;s office.</p>
<p><strong>Downing Street challenged</strong></p>
<p>Blair&#x2019;s former defence minister Peter Kilfoyle challenged Downing Street to publish the transcript.</p>

<p>&#x201C;I believe that Downing Street ought to publish this memo in the interests of transparency, given that much of the detail appears to be in the public domain,&#x201D;&#xA0;Kilfoyle told the Press Association.</p>
<p></p>
<p>&#x201C;I think they ought to clarify what exactly happened on this occasion. If it was the case that President Bush wanted to bomb Aljazeera in what is after all a friendly country, it speaks volumes and it raises questions about subsequent attacks that took place on the press that wasn&#x2019;t embedded with coalition forces.&#x201D;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Liberal Democrat foreign affairs spokesman Sir Menzies Campbell told the Press Association: &#x201C;If true, then this underlines the desperation of the Bush administration as events in Iraq began to spiral out of control.</p>
<p>&#x201C;On this occasion, the prime minister may have been successful in averting political disaster, but it shows how dangerous his relationship with President Bush has been.&#x201D;</p>
<p><strong>Abd al-Bari Atwan&#x2019;s reaction</strong></p>
<p>Speaking to Aljazeera from London on Monday, Abd al-Bari Atwan, chief editor of the London-based Al-Quds al-Arabi newspaper, said: &#x201C;The issue of Bush&#x2019;s plan to bomb Aljazeera&#x2019;s headquarters in Doha will be widely discussed in Washington and London.<br>&#xA0;<br>&#x201C;Reporters in the US and Britain are enraged by reported US plans to use force against media organs.&#xA0;<br>&#xA0;</p>

<p>&#x201C;Arab and international media organs&#xA0;are now&#xA0;under a terrorist campaign launched by the US as it does not want the truth to be revealed.&#xA0;<br>&#xA0;<br>&#x201C;This [US] administration has been disgraced as it has used immoral and illegal ways to occupy and tear out a country, kill more than 100,000 and wound more than 400,000 of its people.<br>&#xA0;<br>&#x201C;The results of the war, being revealed now in Iraq, have forced reporters to ask why they have been misled. <br>&#xA0;<br>&#x201C;New York Times has apologised, saying it has misled public opinion when it did not accurately investigate the objectives of the US administration. <br>&#xA0;<br>&#x201C;I believe that considering use force against a media station is the worst kind of media terrorism practised by a country which pretends to lead the free world, democratic values and media freedom.&#x201D;</p>
