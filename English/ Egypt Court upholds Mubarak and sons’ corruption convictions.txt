<p>The highest appeals court in <a href="/topics/country/egypt.html">Egypt</a> rejected a motion by former president <a href="/topics/people/hosni-mubarak.html">Hosni Mubarak</a> and his two sons to overturn their <a href="/topics/issues/corruption.html">corruption</a> convictions related to his nearly 30-year rule.&#xA0;</p>
<p>Egypt&#x2019;s Court of Cessation denied the Mubaraks&#x2019; appeals on Saturday.</p>
<p>Mubarak, 90, Gamal, and his third son Alaa were sentenced in 2014 to three years&#x2019; imprisonment each for using funds originally intended for the maintenance of presidential palaces to build and upgrade private residences.&#xA0;</p>
<p>The sons were released in 2015 and Mubarak was freed last year. Alaa and Gamal are currently <a href="/news/2018/09/egypt-mubarak-sons-arrested-alleged-stock-manipulation-180915134157577.html">on trial</a> for insider trading.&#xA0;</p>
<p><span><span><span>The court&#x2019;s rejection of their appeal &#x2013; and Gamal&#x2019;s subsequent ineligibility to run for office &#x2013;&#xA0;</span>came after recent comments by the chief editor of state-run Al-Akhbar publications, Yasser Rizq, suggesting frequent public appearances by the younger Mubarak could signal a future presidential run.</span></span></p>
<p><span>&#x201C;His real crime is insulting the dignity of the Egyptian people,&#x201D; Rizq said, alluding to Gamal&#x2019;s one-time intention to succeed his father.</span></p>
<p><span><span>Gamal wielded vast influence in Egypt during the final years of Mubarak&#x2019;s rule.</span></span></p>
<p><span>Rizq first warned Gamal Mubarak against harbouring presidential ambitions in an article published in May. He repeated the warning in a television interview earlier this week.</span></p>
<p>Rizq said it was not improbable that&#xA0;Gamal would strike a political deal with the outlawed <a href="/indepth/features/2017/06/muslim-brotherhood-explained-170608091709865.html">Muslim Brotherhood</a> to secure the group&#x2019;s return to politics &#x2013; in exchange for its support in a presidential bid in 2022, when&#xA0;President <a href="/news/2018/09/woodward-trump-mocked-egypt-sisi-calling-killer-180912064219643.html">Abdel Fattah el-Sisi</a>&#x2018;s&#xA0;second term ends.</p>
<h2><strong>Real challenge to Sisi?</strong></h2>
<p>Sisi led the military&#x2019;s 2013 overthrow of&#xA0;Egypt&#x2019;s&#xA0;first freely elected president, <a href="/news/2016/06/profile-egypt-deposed-president-mohamed-morsi-160607074148919.html">Mohammed Morsi</a>, a member of the Muslim Brotherhood.</p>

<p>Since then Sisi&#x2019;s government has overseen a massive crackdown on Morsi&#x2019;s supporters, jailing thousands along with secular activists behind the 2011 uprising that&#xA0;<a href="/news/2017/03/hosni-mubarak-acquitted-2011-protester-killings-170302152023669.html">overthrew</a>&#xA0;Mubarak.</p>
<p>Egypt&#x2019;s constitution prohibits Sisi from running for a third term in office, but his supporters have raised the spectre of amending the 2014 charter to allow him to do so, or extend the duration of his term.</p>
<p>Sisi won a second, four-year term in office this year in an election in which his only opponent was a little-known politician viewed as among his staunchest supporters.</p>
<p><span>Riza&#x2019;s attack on Gamal Mubarak mirrors past campaigns by the pro-government media against potential challengers to Sisi, which have included personal attacks and unsubstantiated accusations. </span></p>
<p><span>The suggestion that Gamal might strike a deal with the Brotherhood to rise to power carries a thinly veiled threat given the country&#x2019;s political climate, where suspicion of links to the group has provided authorities with grounds to imprison critics, including some with established secular credentials.</span></p>
