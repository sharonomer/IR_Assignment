<p>US officials have denied any role in the apparent killing of an Iranian nuclear scientist,&#xA0;and&#xA0;condemned&#xA0;the bomb attack which Tehran said was linked to Washington and Israel.</p>
<p>&#x201C;I want to categorically deny any United States involvement in any kind of act of violence inside Iran,&#x201D; Hillary Clinton, the US Secretary of State,&#xA0;told reporters on Wednesday when asked about Iranian allegations over the attack.</p>
<p>Tommy Vietor, a National Security Council spokesman, added: &#x201C;The United States had absolutely nothing to do with this. We strongly condemn all acts of violence, including acts of violence like this.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Victoria Nuland, Clinton&#x2019;s spokeswoman,&#xA0;said the state department condemned &#x201C;any assassination or attack on an innocent person and we express our sympathies to the family&#x201D;.</p>
<p>This comes following the <a class="InternalLink" href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2012/01/201211162848691713.html">death of Mostafa Ahmadi Roshan</a>, a nuclear scientist who supervised a department at the Natanz uranium enrichment facility.&#xA0;He was killed on Wednesday&#xA0;in an explosion outside a university campus&#xA0;in Tehran.</p>
<p>In a letter, Iran&#x2019;s government demanded the UN Security Council strongly denounce the killing.</p>
<p>Mohammad Khazaee, Iran&#x2019;s UN ambassador,&#xA0;called on UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon, the 15-nation Security Council and UN General Assembly president Nassir Abdulaziz al-Nasser to condemn the killings &#x201C;in the strongest terms&#x201D;.</p>
<p>&#x201C;There is firm evidence that certain foreign quarters are behind such assassinations,&#x201D; Khazaee said.</p>
<p>The country&#x2019;s powerful Revolutionary Guards were also adamant that &#x201C;the terrorist actions against our nuclear scientists and experts is a US-Zionist plot,&#x201D; the AFP news agency reported.</p>
<p><strong>War of words</strong></p>
<p>Wednesday&#x2019;s attack has deepened a war of words between&#xA0;Washington and Tehran already raging over Iranian <a class="InternalLink" href="http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/interactive/2012/01/201211272451573612.html">nuclear ambitions</a> and maritime tensions.</p>
<p>Iranian officials noted that the manner of the attack on Roshan &#x2013; two men on a motorbike attaching a magnetic bomb to the target&#x2019;s vehicle &#x2013; bore similarities to the killings of three other scientists over the past two years.</p>
<p>At least two of those scientists had also been working on nuclear activities. Those attacks were viewed by Iranian officials as assassination operations carried out by Israel&#x2019;s Mossad intelligence service, possibly with US assistance.</p>
<p>Mohammad Reza Rahimi, Iran&#x2019;s vice president, on Wednesday blamed Israeli agents for the attack, but said they could not &#x201C;prevent progress&#x201D; in what Iran claims are peaceful nuclear efforts.</p>
<p>He said the killing was&#xA0;&#x201C;evidence of [foreign] government-sponsored terrorism&#x201D; but&#xA0;vowed it would&#xA0;not stop Iran&#x2019;s nuclear programme.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Today those who claim to be combating terrorism have targeted Iranian scientists,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;They should know that Iranian scientists are more determined than ever in striding towards Iran&#x2019;s progress.&#x201D;</p>
<p>The US and Israel say Iran is trying to develop nuclear weapons technology. Iran denies the allegations, saying that its programme is intended for peaceful purposes.</p>
<p>In Israel, a senior official said he was unaware who carried out Wednesday&#x2019;s attack which he&#xA0;called an act of &#x201C;revenge&#x201D;.</p>
<p>&#x201C;I don&#x2019;t know who took revenge on the Iranian scientist, but I am definitely not shedding a tear,&#x201D; Brigadier General Yoav Mordechai,&#xA0;a&#xA0;military spokesman,&#xA0;wrote on his official Facebook page.</p>
<p><strong>Aircraft carrier deployed</strong></p>
<p>The increased tension over the attack comes as a second US aircraft carrier, the USS Carl Vinson, arrived in the Gulf region, the Pentagon said on Wednesday, in a move it called &#x201C;routine&#x201D;.</p>
<p>The Carl Vinson was due to relieve another aircraft carrier, the USS John Stennis, which is in the region, Pentagon spokesman John Kirby told reporters.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Her deployment in that area is routine, long-planned &#x2013; there&#x2019;s nothing unusual about that,&#x201D; Kirby explained.</p>
<p>Despite the Pentagon&#x2019;s denials of a build-up in the region, the USS Abraham Lincoln was in the Indian Ocean and en route to join the Carl Vinson, according to the US Navy.</p>
<p>&#x201C;The fact that there are two carriers in that AOR [area of responsibility] is not an indication of anything specific in respect to Iran,&#x201D; the spokesman stressed, insisting: &#x201C;There is no change to force posture in the region.&#x201D;</p>
<p>The military buildup comes with the US steadily ratcheting up sanctions on Iran with the aim of fracturing its oil-dependent economy in a bid to halt its nuclear programme.</p>
<p>Iran has responded by saying it could close the Strait of Hormuz, the gateway to the Gulf, potentially blocking&#xA0;the maritime flow of 20 per cent of the world&#x2019;s oil if it is attacked or if sanctions halt its petroleum exports.</p>
