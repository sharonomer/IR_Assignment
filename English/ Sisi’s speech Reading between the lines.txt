<p><span style="font-family:inherit;font-size:14px">Egyptian Field Marshall Abdel Fattah el-Sisi recently committed to doing exactly what he <a class="internallink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=syv4YV8PiSo" target="_blank">promised his June 30 collaborators</a> he would not do &#x2013; run for the presidency.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:inherit;font-size:14px">Sisi&#x2019;s <a class="internallink" href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2014/03/sisi-resignation-speech-full-2014326201638123905.html" target="_blank">speech</a> served as another ominous reminder that Egypt is not headed towards anything resembling a democratic state. He made no reference to gross <a class="internallink" href="http://carnegieendowment.org/2014/03/26/five-questions-for-sisi-egypt-s-man-of-mystery/h5ua" target="_blank">human rights violations</a>, the fact that Egypt&#x2019;s media is mostly <a class="internallink" href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/feb/04/egypt-attack-media-journalists-political-activism" target="_blank">propagandist and one-sided</a>, or the fact that criticism of his person is essentially off limits in Egypt&#x2019;s current public sphere. All that is making a serious debate on political issues and a real competition for president impossible. Significantly, would-be candidates for president <a class="internallink" href="http://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2014/03/16/khaled-ali-announces-will-run-president-2/" target="_blank">have already said</a> they <a class="internallink" href="http://www.almasryalyoum.com/news/details/390733" target="_blank">will not run</a>, citing unfair political conditions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:inherit;font-size:14px">Sisi also did not emphasise national reconciliation or political inclusion. Importantly, Egypt&#x2019;s current &#x201C;roadmap&#x201D; excludes the Muslim Brotherhood, the group that dominated Egyptian elections for the two years immediately following the 2011 uprising against Hosni Mubarak. </span></p>

<p><span><span style="font-family:inherit;font-size:14px">Sisi&#x2019;s discussion of &#x201C;the nation&#x201D; and &#x201C;the will of the people&#x201D; &#x2013; apparent references to his supporters and those who backed the events of June 30 and July 3 &#x2013; was consistent with post-July 3 Egyptian political and media rhetoric. <a class="internallink" href="http://www.opendemocracy.net/arab-awakening/mohamad-elmasry/egypt%E2%80%99s-campaign-of-elimination-pro-june-30-analysts-and-quantitative" target="_blank">This seems to suggest</a> that Egyptians who supported the July 3 military intervention that ended Mohamed Morsi&#x2019;s presidency are patriotic citizens, while those who opposed it are not. </span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:inherit;font-size:14px">In an apparent nod to inclusiveness, Sisi did say that non-criminals would be welcomed as partners &#x201C;to no limit&#x201D;, but this statement would seem to exclude the Brotherhood, who have been <a class="internallink" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/26/world/middleeast/egypt-calls-muslim-brotherhood-a-terrorist-group.html" target="_blank">labelled terrorists</a> and blamed for a <a class="internallink" href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/03/13/us-egypt-army-idUSBREA2C0HG20140313" target="_blank">host of crimes</a>. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:inherit;font-size:14px">Sisi also made it clear that his aim in running for president is to &#x201C;serve&#x201D; Egyptians in typical military fashion, with his speech exhibiting significant strongman characteristics. For instance, in the speech, he highlighted his military uniform and history, said he would serve Egypt as &#x201C;a soldier&#x201D;, suggested that Egypt&#x2019;s key battle is against &#x201C;terrorists&#x2026; who are working for the destruction of our lives&#x201D;, and lamented that both the &#x201C;prestige of the state&#x201D; and the &#x201C;state apparatus&#x201D; had been severely damaged in the aftermath of the January 2011 uprising. He strongly suggested that his presidency would be able to address these problems. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:inherit;font-size:14px">Although he claimed he desired a &#x201C;democratic&#x201D; and &#x201C;modern&#x201D; state, and said he would respect the outcome of any election, he offered no assurances, and, more importantly, chose to ignore obvious and important prerequisites to a democratic turn. Any chance at democracy in the short term would require, at a bare minimum, the release of the <a class="internallink" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/24/egypt-death-deep-state-editorial" target="_blank">16,000 political prisoners</a> currently held in Egyptian jails and police stations,&#xA0;independent investigations into <a class="internallink" href="http://www.hrw.org/news/2013/08/19/egypt-security-forces-used-excessive-lethal-force" target="_blank">mass killings</a>, and allowing all of Egypt&#x2019;s political entities to participate equally in political life.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:inherit;font-size:14px">Given the degree to which Sisi&#x2019;s post-July 3 government is implicated in crimes, such measures remain highly unlikely. It is perhaps not surprising, then, that his speech did not broach these issues or offer any indication of a serious democratic transition.&#xA0;</span></p>
