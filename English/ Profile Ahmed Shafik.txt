<p>Ahmed Shafik, a close associate of President Hosni Mubarak, has been appointed as Egypt&#x2019;s prime minister in response to mass protests in Cairo and other cities.</p>
<p>Shafik had been minister of civil aviation since 2002.</p>
<p>He served as commander of the Egyptian air force from 1996 to 2002, a post Mubarak himself held before he became vice-president of Egypt under former President Anwar Sadat.</p>
<p>His bid to run for Egypt&#x2019;s president after the revolution is being opposed by those who feel that remnants of Mubarak&#x2019;s regime should not be eligible for the office of the presidency.</p>
<p>As minister of civil aviation, Shafik won a reputation for efficiency and administrative competence. He has supervised a successful modernisation programme at the state airline EgyptAir and improvements to the country&#x2019;s airports.</p>
<p>He was born in Cairo in 1941 and joined the air force at the age of 20.</p>
<p>He spent decades as a fighter pilot, and flew under Mubarak&#x2019;s command during the 1973 Arab-Israeli war. It is claimed that Shafik shot down two Israeli planes on October 14.</p>
<p>He holds a master&#x2019;s degree in military sciences and a PhD in the national strategy of outer-space.</p>
