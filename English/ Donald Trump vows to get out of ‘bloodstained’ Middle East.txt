<p>The <a href="/topics/country/united-states.html">United States</a> will leave the &#x201C;blood-stained sand&#x201D; of the Middle East, President <a href="/topics/people/donald-trump.html">Donald Trump</a> said, adding the US no longer needs to be the world&#x2019;s policeman.</p>
<p>Trump spoke&#xA0;on Wednesday in a special address from the White House and declared a change of course in US relations with the <a href="/topics/regions/middleeast.html">Middle East</a>, where he said too many American service members had died.</p>
<p>&#x201C;We&#x2019;re getting out. Let someone else fight over this long blood-stained sand. The job of our military is not to police the world,&#x201D; the US president said.&#xA0;</p>
<p>Trump has been under fire for&#xA0;<a href="/news/2019/10/white-house-turkey-military-operation-northern-syria-191007034354242.html">abruptly withdrawing US troops</a>&#xA0;from northern Syria, with many accusing him of abandoning Kurdish forces, who had been one of the US&#x2019;s main allies in the fight against the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (<a href="/topics/organisations/isis-isil.html">ISIL</a> or ISIS).</p>
<p>Following the pullout,&#xA0;<a href="/news/2019/10/turkey-military-operation-syria-latest-updates-191011060434166.html">Turkey launched an offensive</a>&#xA0;against Kurdish fighters in the region. Last week, <a href="/topics/country/Turkey.html">Turkey</a> agreed to a five-day ceasefire to allow Kurdish forces to withdraw from the border area.&#xA0;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Other nations must step up and do their fair share,&#x201D; said Trump of conflict in the region. &#x201C;I am committed to pursuing a different course, one that leads to victory for America.&#x201D;</p>

<p>It was unclear when American troops in the region would begin returning home. Hundreds previously deployed in Syria are now based in western Iraq.&#xA0;</p>
<p>Trump also said some forces would remain in Syria&#x2019;s oil fields despite the broader US withdrawal from the country.&#xA0;</p>
<p>&#x201C;We have secured the oil and, therefore, a small number of US troops will remain in the area where they have the oil,&#x201D; he said.</p>
<h2><strong>Russian intervention</strong></h2>
<p>Under the ceasefire agreement, <a href="/topics/country/Russia.html">Russia</a> and <a href="/topics/country/Syria.html">Syria</a> will &#x201C;facilitate the removal&#x201D; from Turkey&#x2019;s border region of the Kurdish People&#x2019;s Protection Units (YPG) fighters.</p>
<p>Russia on Wednesday&#xA0;<a href="/news/2019/10/russia-urges-kurdish-fighters-withdraw-syria-border-191023073358905.html">warned Kurdish forces</a> to quickly withdraw&#xA0;from the <a href="/topics/subjects/turkey-syria-border.html">Turkey-Syria border</a> or be crushed by the Turkish army. Moscow added the US &#x201C;betrayed and abandoned&#x201D; Syrian fighters.

<p>More than 176,000 people have been displaced by the Turkish offensive and hundreds of imprisoned ISIL fighters have escaped during the conflict.</p>
<p><span>The fate of ISIL fighters in Syrian Kurdish prisons remains up in the air. A senior Trump administration official said while most remained under lock and key, it appeared a small number had fled from YPG incarceration.</span></p>

<h2><strong>NATO condemnation?</strong></h2>
<p>US defence chief Mark Esper is expected to focus on Turkey&#x2019;s operation and the future of the fight against ISIL when he meets <a href="/topics/organisations/nato.html">NATO</a> partners in Brussels on Thursday.&#xA0;</p>
<p>Esper lashed out at Turkey for its military assault on Syrian Kurdish fighters across the border into Syria, saying Ankara is &#x201C;heading in the wrong direction&#x201D; and is getting closer to Russia.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Turkey put us all in a very terrible situation,&#x201D; he said, adding Ankara needs to return to being the &#x201C;responsible ally&#x201D; it has been in the past.</p>
<p>Rachel Rizzo, a fellow at the Center for a New American Security think-tank, said the Pentagon chief has few options to punish NATO member Turkey.</p>
<p>&#x201C;As far as NATO-level punishment, I don&#x2019;t see really what is possible,&#x201D; Rizzo said.</p>
<p>A number of European countries have suspended weapons sales to Turkey over its military campaign.</p>
<p>French President Emmanuel Macron on Friday decried NATO&#x2019;s inability to react to what he called Turkey&#x2019;s &#x201C;crazy&#x201D; offensive, and said it was time Europe stopped acting like a junior ally when it came to the Middle East.</p>
<p>Turkey&#x2019;s Defence Minister Hulusi Akar said despite criticism from allies over the Syria incursion and its growing ties with Moscow, Turkey remained at the heart of NATO.</p>
<p>&#x201C;We are at the centre of NATO and we remain determined to carry out all of our responsibilities fully. We are going nowhere,&#x201D; he said.</p>
