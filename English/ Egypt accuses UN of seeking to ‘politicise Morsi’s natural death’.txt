<p><a href="/topics/country/egypt.html">Egypt</a> is accusing the <a href="/topics/organisations/un.html">United Nations</a> of seeking to &#x201C;politicise&#x201D; the death in court of the country&#x2019;s first democratically elected president <a href="/topics/people/mohamed-morsi.html">Mohamed Morsi</a> by calling for an &#x201C;independent inquiry&#x201D;.</p>
<p>Foreign ministry spokesperson Ahmed Hafez said on Wednesday he condemned &#x201C;in the strongest terms&#x201D; the call by&#xA0;<span>Rupert Colville,</span>&#xA0;spokesperson for the UN high commissioner for human rights, for an <a href="/news/2019/06/calls-prompt-transparent-probe-morsi-death-190619004225655.html">independent investigation</a> into Morsi&#x2019;s death on Monday.</p>
<p>Hafez said it was a &#x201C;deliberate attempt to politicise a case of natural death&#x201D;.</p>
<p>Egypt&#x2019;s first official comments on Morsi&#x2019;s death came amid growing criticism about prison conditions in the Middle East nation.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, Colville called for a probe into whether the conditions Morsi faced during his nearly six years in custody had contributed to his death.</p>

<p>&#x201C;Any sudden death in custody must be followed by a prompt, impartial, thorough and transparent investigation carried out by an independent body to clarify the cause of death,&#x201D; he said. </p>
<p>&#x201C;Concerns have been raised regarding the conditions of Mr Morsi&#x2019;s detention, including access to adequate medical care, as well as sufficient access to his lawyers and family,&#x201D; Colville added. </p>
<p>He said the investigation must &#x201C;encompass all aspects of the authorities&#x2019; treatment of Mr Morsi to examine whether the conditions of his detention had an impact on his death.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Morsi was buried in a small family ceremony early on Tuesday a day after he suffered a fatal heart attack in a Cairo court, his sons said.</p>
<p>Morsi was overthrown on July 3, 2013, after barely a year in power, in a coup staged by current President <a href="/topics/people/abdel-fattah-el-sisi.html">Abdel Fattah el-Sisi</a>.&#xA0;He was placed under house arrest before being moved to prison.</p>
<h2><span>&#x2018;Entirely predictable&#x2019;</span></h2>
<p>Rights groups Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch have also called for a credible investigation into Morsi&#x2019;s death.</p>
<p>&#x201C;The government of Egypt today bears responsibility for his death, given their failure to provide him with adequate medical care or basic prisoner rights,&#x201D; HRW said in a statement to Al Jazeera.</p>
<p>&#x201C;He&#x2019;s been in prison and treated worse than the already terrible conditions for Egypt&#x2019;s prisoners,&#x201D; Sarah Leah Whitson, executive director of HRW&#x2019;s Middle East and North Africa division, told Al Jazeera, decrying Morsi&#x2019;s &#x201C;terrible but entirely predictable&#x201D; death.</p>
<p>&#x201C;The Egyptian government has known very clearly about his declining medical state. He had lost a great deal of weight, he had fainted in court a number of times and was being kept in almost around-the-clock solitary confinement.&#x201D;</p>

<p>A leading member of the <a href="/indepth/features/2017/06/muslim-brotherhood-explained-170608091709865.html">Muslim Brotherhood</a> group, Morsi won Egypt&#x2019;s first free presidential election in 2012, a year after an uprising that toppled longtime leader Hosni Mubarak.</p>
<p>Turkey&#x2019;s ruling AK Party supported Morsi&#x2019;s government and the country hosted many Brotherhood members and supporters who fled to Turkey since the group&#x2019;s activities were banned in Egypt in 2013.</p>
<p>&#x201C;There are Arab dissidents &#x2026; in Turkey since the Arab Spring &#x2026; and people are here to give support for Morsi&#x2019;s cause,&#x201D; said Al Jazeera&#x2019;s Sinem Koseoglu, reporting from Istanbul&#x2019;s Fatih Mosque where thousands had come, including President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, to <a href="/news/2019/06/mosques-turkey-hold-funeral-prayers-mohamed-morsi-honour-190618113458552.html">attend a prayer service</a> for Morsi.</p>
<p>At the time of his death, Morsi, 67, faced a host of legal charges, which he, along with many human rights groups and independent observers, said were politically motivated.</p>
<p>Thousands of members of the now-outlawed Muslim Brotherhood, who were arrested in the crackdown following the 2013 coup, are still languishing in jails.</p>
<p>Egypt&#x2019;s government has dismissed accusations that the former president was badly treated.</p>
