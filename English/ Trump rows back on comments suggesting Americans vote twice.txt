<p>US President Donald Trump said on Thursday that people who vote early by mail should show up at polling places and vote again if their ballots have not been counted, a walk back from previous comments a day earlier when he suggested <a href="/news/2020/09/trump-encourages-citizens-illegally-vote-200903132156769.html">residents</a> vote twice to test the mail-in system.</p>
<p>Trump has <a href="/news/2020/07/trump-floats-election-delay-claims-voter-fraud-risks-virus-200730132441917.html">repeatedly asserted</a>, without evidence, that mail-in voting &#x2013; expanded by some states because of the coronavirus pandemic &#x2013; would increase <a href="/news/2020/08/trump-campaign-sues-nevada-inevitable-voter-fraud-200805124300335.html">fraud</a> and disrupt the November 3 election, although experts say voter fraud of any kind is extremely rare in the United States.</p>
<p>The president said people could mail in their ballots as early as possible and then follow up with a trip to the polls to see whether their mail-in vote was tabulated.</p>
<p>&#x201C;If it has you will not be able to Vote &amp; the Mail In System worked properly,&#x201D; Trump said in a lengthy tweet.</p>
<p>&#x201C;If it has not been Counted, VOTE (which is a citizen&#x2019;s right to do).&#x201D;</p>

<p>If the mail-in ballot gets to election officials after a person votes at the polls, the in-person vote will be ignored, he said.</p>
<p>&#x201C;YOU ARE NOW ASSURED THAT YOUR PRECIOUS VOTE HAS BEEN COUNTED, it hasn&#x2019;t been &#x2018;lost, thrown out, or in any way destroyed&#x2019;.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Trump first made the suggestion during his trip on Wednesday to Wilmington, North Carolina.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Let them send it in and let them go vote,&#x201D; he said in an interview with WECT-TV. &#x201C;And if the system is as good as they say it is then obviously they won&#x2019;t be able to vote&#x201D; in person.</p>
<p>Voting more than once in an election is illegal and in some states, including North Carolina, it is a felony not only to vote more than once but also to induce another to do so.</p>
<p>Ballots are due to be mailed in North Carolina on Friday.</p>
<p>The state&#x2019;s Attorney General Josh Stein, a Democrat, wrote on Twitter that Trump, a Republican, had &#x201C;outrageously encouraged&#x201D; North Carolinians &#x201C;to break the law in order to help him sow chaos in our election&#x201D;.</p>
<p>Stein wrote: &#x201C;Make sure you vote, but do NOT vote twice! I will do everything in my power to make sure the will of the people is upheld in November.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Trump&#x2019;s campaign and the White House also denied that he meant to tell people to vote twice.</p>
<p>&#x201C;The president is not suggesting anyone do anything unlawful,&#x201D; White House spokeswoman Kayleigh McEnany told Fox News on Thursday. &#x201C;What he said very clearly there is make sure your vote is tabulated and if it is not, then vote.&#x201D;</p>
<h2>Felonious double voting</h2>
<p>The Democratic National Committee accused Trump of encouraging voter fraud and said the president was undermining confidence in the fairness of the election.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Let&#x2019;s be clear: <a href="/news/2020/08/trump-attacks-mail-votes-cost-republicans-200807121559809.html">Voting by mail</a> is a safe and secure way for Americans to participate in our democracy &#x2013; and Trump should be working to make it easier to vote, not harder,&#x201D; Reyna Walters-Morgan, the DNC&#x2019;s director of voter protection, said in a statement.</p>
<p>Patrick Gannon, a spokesman for the North Carolina State Board of Elections, said a person would not be able to cast two ballots, regardless of if they voted by mail or in-person first. The first vote that is received and processed is the one that counts, he said.</p>

<p>&#x201C;Voting twice in an election is a felony,&#x201D; Gannon said. &#x201C;If you put a ballot in the mail, and it hasn&#x2019;t arrived yet, and then you vote in-person before your absentee ballot has arrived, your in-person vote will count.&#x201D;</p>
<p>He said if an absentee ballot showed up after a person had voted in-person, it would not be counted.</p>
<p>Many Americans vote by mail because they cannot make it to the polls in person. Nearly one in four voters cast presidential ballots by mail in 2016.</p>
<p>The coronavirus pandemic is expected to result in a record number of mail-in ballots this year as voters seek to avoid the risk of infection. Experts have cautioned the expected surge means a winner may not be clear on election night given the time it will take to count and verify all the ballots.</p>
<p>Trump campaigned on Wednesday in North Carolina, known as a battleground state because its population can swing either to Republicans or Democrats and play a decisive role in presidential elections.</p>
<p>National opinion polls suggest Trump, 74, is trailing his Democratic rival Joe Biden, 77, the vice president under then-President Barack Obama. Democrats accuse Republicans of trying to suppress the vote to help their side.</p>
<p>However, the race is much tighter in battleground states, which are crucial for both candidates.</p>
