<p>An Egyptian court has begun the retrial of former president Hosni Mubarak and his sons for alleged embezzlement charges.</p>
<p>They are accused of diverting public funds earmarked for the renovation of presidential palaces to upgrade family properties.</p>
<p>Mubarak, 86, toppled in a 2011 popular uprising, was sentenced to three years in prison last May. His two sons were given four-year jail terms in the same case. </p>
<p>In January, Egypt&#x2019;s <a class="internallink" href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2015/01/egypt-retrial-mubarak-201511383311873375.html" target="_parent">high court overturned</a> the conviction against Mubarak, who is currently being treated in a military hospital in Cairo. </p>
<p>Egyptian state television aired brief footage of Mubarak and his sons inside a cage in the courtroom in the Police Academy. </p>
<p>In November, a court dropped charges against Mubarak of conspiring to kill protesters in the 2011 uprising, raising fears among human rights activists that the old guard was making a comeback.</p>
<p>Many Egyptians who lived through Mubarak&#x2019;s rule view it as a period of autocracy and crony capitalism.</p>
<p>His overthrow led to Egypt&#x2019;s first free election, although Mohamed Morsi, who won the election, was removed from the presidency in 2013 by then-army chief Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, following protests against Morsi&#x2019;s rule.</p>
<p>Sisi, who went on to win a presidential election last May, launched a fierce crackdown on Morsi and his Muslim Brotherhood group.</p>
<p>Authorities have jailed thousands of Brotherhood supporters and sentenced hundreds to death in mass trials that drew international criticism.</p>
