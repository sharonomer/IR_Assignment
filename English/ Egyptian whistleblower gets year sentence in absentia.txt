<p>A self-exiled Egyptian businessman whose allegations of corruption against the country&#x2019;s military sparked rare protests has been sentenced in absentia to five years in prison for tax evasion.</p>
<p><a href="/news/2019/09/mohamed-ali-man-calling-el-sisi-removal-190921014032765.html">Mohamed Ali</a>&#xA0;released a series of videos from Spain earlier this year, pitching himself as a former government insider who witnessed <a href="/ajimpact/egyptian-contractor-targeted-sisi-allegations-190905135843139.html">high-level corruption</a> and large-scale misuse of funds as a construction contractor for the military. He did not provide evidence to support his claims.</p>
<p>He also called for the removal of Egyptian President <a href="/topics/people/abdel-fattah-el-sisi.html">Abdel Fattah el-Sisi</a>, a former military officer. El-Sisi <a href="/news/2019/09/egypt-corruption-president-el-sisi-denies-wrongdoing-190915072848667.html">dismissed</a> the corruption accusations as &#x201C;sheer lies and defamation&#x201D;.</p>
<p>Ali&#x2019;s videos were widely viewed and sparked scattered <a href="/news/2019/09/egypt-thousands-streets-demanding-sisi-resignation-190920205701643.html">street protests</a> against the president in several Egyptian cities in September. Public protests have been almost completely silenced over the past few years by draconian measures imposed under el-Sisi.</p>
<p>After they swiftly stamped out the demonstrations, security forces escalated a long-running crackdown on suspected dissidents, jailing thousands in the weeks that followed. Hundreds have since been released.</p>
<p>According to Monday&#x2019;s online version of the Al-Akhbar daily, a Cairo criminal court also sentenced Ali over the weekend to pay 42 million Egyptian pounds ($2.6m) after his firm, Amlak, failed to settle a dispute with the government on taxes owed between October 2012 and September 2016.</p>
<p>He was also fined 50,000 Egyptian pounds ($3,100). Al-Akhbar did not specify the day of the sentencing. The verdict can be appealed.</p>

<h2><strong>Countless contracts</strong></h2>
<p>Ali said he left Egypt while the military owed him 220 million Egyptian pounds ($13m) for services he provided.</p>
<p>During the more than 15 years of working with the military, Ali said his company routinely paid bribes to the military&#x2019;s business arm, the so-called Engineering Authority, to secure countless contracts for lucrative projects, such as the building of presidential palaces and luxury hotels.</p>
<p>While dismissing the corruption allegations, el-Sisi has said he would continue building new presidential residences for the good of Egypt. &#x201C;I am building a new country,&#x201D; he said.</p>
<p>Over the years, critics have questioned the expanding role of the military in the business world and its economic interests, as well as its seemingly unfair competition with the country&#x2019;s private sector. They say the military enjoys advantages because it is exempted from taxation and proper auditing.</p>
<p>In recent remarks, military spokesman Tamer al-Rifai said the army has carried out 2,300 projects employing five million Egyptians.</p>
<p>El-Sisi said his government has carried out projects worth more than $245bn. He said he would inaugurate 14 new cities next year.</p>
<p>The president said the projects, ranging from new roads and housing complexes to an $8.5bn military-led expansion of the Suez Canal, attract investors and create jobs.</p>
<p>As defence minister, el-Sisi led the military&#x2019;s 2013 overthrow of <a href="/topics/people/mohamed-morsi.html">Mohamed Morsi</a>, the country&#x2019;s first democratically elected president, whose one-year rule proved divisive and sparked nationwide protests.</p>
