<p>Donald Trump has challenged Hillary Clinton to a drug test before their next debate, suggesting the Democrat was &#x201C;pumped up&#x201D; on performance-enhancing drugs.</p>
<p>The attack from the Republican nominee came as he accused &#x201C;corrupt&#x201D; media of seeking to rig November&#x2019;s vote in his Democratic rival&#x2019;s favour, by reporting snowballing claims of his sexual misconduct.</p>
<p>Trump has trampled on all conventions in his treatment of his opponent, vowing if elected to jail her over her email practices as secretary of state &#x2013; and making &#x201C;Lock Her Up&#x201D; a rallying cry for his supporters.</p>
<p><span>His campaign has actively bruited theories about Clinton&#x2019;s health, seizing on her bout of pneumonia last month to suggest she is concealing a major health problem, and is unfit for office.</span></p>

<p>In a new attack, he suggested she had taken drugs before their last debate, and called for her to be tested ahead of their final duel on Wednesday in Las Vegas.</p>
<p>&#x201C;I don&#x2019;t know what is going on with her,&#x201D; Trump, 70, told a rally in Portsmouth, New Hampshire.</p>
<p>&#x201C;At the beginning of her last debate, she was all pumped up at the beginning. At the end, it was like, &#x2018;Take me down.&#x2019; She could barely reach her car.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Athletes, they make them take a drug test. I think we should take a drug test prior to the debate. Why don&#x2019;t we do that?&#x201D;</p>
<p>Saturday&#x2019;s attack on his Democratic rival marked yet another escalation of Trump&#x2019;s electoral strategy heading into the final weeks of a race that has defied all political norms.</p>
<p>As Trump falls in the polls &#x2013; abandoned by part of his own camp &#x2013; he has spent the week claiming the media and a &#x201C;global elite&#x201D; are working against him, alleging that Clinton plotted to destroy the sovereignty of the US.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Hillary is running for president in what looks like a rigged election,&#x201D; he charged in New Hampshire.</p>
<p>&#x201C;The election is being rigged by corrupt media pushing completely false allegations and outright lies in an effort to elect her president.&#x201D;</p>
<h2>Unwanted advances</h2>
<p>Ten women have now come forward to say they were the victim of unwanted advances by Trump.</p>
<p>He vehemently denies the women&#x2019;s allegations.</p>
<p>For her part, Clinton has scaled back her campaign commitments, keeping a low profile as Trump battles the allegations, set off by the release last week of a video of him bragging about groping women.</p>
<p>But the Clinton camp issued a prompt response to Trump&#x2019;s latest comments on the election, accusing him of seeking to erode public faith in the vote.</p>
<p><span>In a statement, Robby Mook, <span>Clinton&#x2019;s campaign manager,</span>&#xA0;said:&#xA0;</span>&#x201C;This election will have record turnout, because voters see through Donald Trump&#x2019;s shameful attempts to undermine an election weeks before it happens.&#x201D;</p>
