<p>&#x201C;The Gamaa Islamiya in Egypt stresses the lack of truth in what Aljazeera aired by Dr Ayman al-Zawahiri about it joining al-Qaeda, and categorically denies this,&#x201D; the group&#xA0;said in a statement on its <a href="http://www.egyptianislamicgroup.com/" target="_blank">website</a>.</p>
<p></p>
<p>And a former official in Egypt&#x2019;s Gamaa Islamiya said that even if some members had joined al-Qaeda &#x2013;&#xA0;as al-Qaeda deputy leader Ayman al-Zawahiri said in a video aired on Aljazeera on Saturday &#x2013;&#xA0;it was unlikely that most would do so.</p>
<p>The group&#xA0;fought a bloody campaign against the government in the 1990s to set up an Islamic state before&#xA0;declaring a truce in 1997.</p>
<p>Sheikh Abdel Akher Hammad, a former Gamaa leader, told Aljazeera on Sunday from Germany: &#x201C;If [some] brothers &#x2026; have joined, then this is their personal view and I don&#x2019;t think that most Gamaa Islamiya members share that same opinion.&#x201D;</p>
<p><strong>No al-Qaeda support</strong></p>
<p>Egypt analysts have downplayed al-Zawahiri&#x2019;s announcement that a &#x201C;big faction&#x201D; of the Gamaa had switched over, saying there was no evidence al-Qaeda had major support within the group&#x2019;s&#xA0;ranks.</p>
<p>In the video, al-Zawahiri named Mohamed al-Islambouli as one of those who joined al-Qaeda, referring to the Gamaa leader whose brother Khaled killed Anwar Sadat, the then Egyptian president, in 1981.</p>
<p>A man introduced by al-Zawahiri as another Gamaa leader, Mohamed Hakaima, later appeared in the video to confirm the unity move. But several analysts said he was not a major player.</p>
<p>Diaa Rashwan,&#xA0;a specialist on Islamist groups at the al-Ahram Centre for Political and Strategic Studies, said Hakaima &#x201C;doesn&#x2019;t represent anybody here in the country&#x201D;,&#xA0;describing him as a &#x201C;low-ranking member&#x201D; of the group.</p>
<p>Egypt detained many thousands of Gamaa members or sympathisers in the 1990s when the group was waging a low-level guerrilla war against security forces, mainly in the south.</p>
<p>But hundreds have since come out of detention after renouncing violence. Gamaa leaders declared a truce after a deadly 1997 attack on tourists in&#xA0;Luxor.</p>
<p>Analysts said they did not expect any change in the group&#x2019;s policy after the al-Qaeda announcement, saying its leadership had clearly chosen to avoid violence in Egypt.</p>
