<p>Pakistani news reports speculate that he was killed in a US drone strike, but US officials would not comment.</p>
<p>&#x201C;And there&#x2019;s some controversy here, because nobody in Pakistan has confirmed where he was killed,&#x201D; Al Jazeera&#x2019;s Imran Khan, reporting from Lahore, said.</p>
<p>The US government also alleged that he helped to funnel money to some of the hijackers in the September 11, 2001 attacks in the US.</p>
<p>Al-Yazid headed al-Qaeda&#x2019;s Afghanistan branch for several years, and reportedly ran many of the group&#x2019;s operations in both Afghanistan and Pakistan.</p>
<p>&#x201C;He was also the organisation&#x2019;s prime conduit to bin Laden and Zawahiri,&#x201D; the US official said, referring to al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden and his deputy, Ayman al-Zawahiri.</p>
<p>The al-Qaeda message&#xA0;said that&#xA0;al-Yazid&#x2019;s wife, and several other family members, were killed along with him.</p>
<p>Al-Yazid was a former member of Egypt&#x2019;s Islamic Jihad organisation and spent time in prison after Anwar Sadat, the former Egyptian president, was assassinated in 1981.</p>
<p>His last public statement was issued on May 4, wherein he praised Abu Omar al-Baghdadi and Abu Ayyub al-Masri, the two al-Qaeda in Iraq leaders killed in a raid in April.</p>
