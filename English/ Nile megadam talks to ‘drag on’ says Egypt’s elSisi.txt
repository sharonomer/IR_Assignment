<p>Egypt&#x2019;s President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi has said talks about Ethiopia&#x2019;s Nile dam would &#x201C;drag on&#x201D; but voiced hope for a negotiated settlement to the dispute.</p>
<p><span>El-Sisi&#x2019;s comments, in a speech on Tuesday, came amid heightened tensions between Egypt, Sudan and Ethiopia over the vast Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam on the Blue Nile.&#xA0;</span></p>
<p><span>For nearly a decade, talks about the operation and filling of the mega-dam have faltered.</span></p>
<p>&#x201C;We are negotiating, and these negotiations will be a long battle,&#x201D; el-Sisi said, before adding, &#x201C;we will succeed, God willing.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Last week, Ethiopia announced it had reached its first-year target for filling the reservoir, a move that sparked anxiety in downstream Egypt and Sudan, who fear for their vital water supplies. </p>
<p>El-Sisi said Egyptians&#x2019; fears over the dam are &#x201C;legitimate and natural&#x201D; but warned the media against making &#x201C;threats&#x201D; of military action.&#xA0;</p>

<p>The long-running dispute has recently overflowed online, with Egyptians and Ethiopians sparring in online posts over their rights to the Nile&#x2019;s waters.</p>
<p>Cairo has feared Ethiopia&#x2019;s dam would severely cut into its share of the Nile, which provides 97 percent of the water needs of more than 100 million Egyptians.</p>
<p>Ethiopia, which began building the dam in 2011 and hopes it will produce vast amounts of electricity for its slightly larger population, said it is vital for its development.</p>
<p>It has insisted downstream countries&#x2019; water supplies will not be affected. </p>
<p>Sudan hoped the dam would help regulate flooding, but in June, it warned that millions of lives would be at &#x201C;great risk&#x201D; if Ethiopia unilaterally fills the dam.</p>
<p>The Nile, the world&#x2019;s longest river, is a lifeline supplying both water and electricity to the 10 countries it crosses.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, Ethiopian Prime Minister&#xA0;Abiy Ahmed&#xA0;hailed the &#x201C;historic&#x201D; early filling of the dam.</p>
<p>&#x201C;The completion of the first round of filling is a historic moment that showcases Ethiopians&#x2019; commitment to the renaissance of our country,&#x201D; Abiy, the 2019 Nobel Peace laureate, said.</p>
<p>&#x201C;The fact that we reached this milestone by our own efforts when no one else believed in our capabilities to accomplish such initiatives makes the moment even more historic.</p>
<p><span>&#x201C;We conducted the filling of the dam without causing harm to anyone,&#x201D; said Abiy.</span></p>
