<p>Egypt&#x2019;s President Mohamed Morsi&#xA0;has pardoned all political prisoners detained since the&#xA0;start of protests that toppled Hosni Mubarak last year.</p>
<p>The pardon covers citizens facing trial and those serving&#xA0;jail sentences except for those convicted of murder, the&#xA0;presidential spokesman said on Monday, but did not give a specific number&#xA0;for the pardoned prisoners.</p>
<p>Activists have said that thousands of civilians ended up in&#xA0;army courts in the security vacuum that followed the fall of&#xA0;Mubarak in 2011. The campaign group, No to Military Trials, said at least 5,000 political prisoners were still in jail.</p>
<p>The move by Morsi was long demanded by Egypt&#x2019;s youth groups behind the uprising.</p>
<p>Many of those jailed were arrested in the protests that&#xA0;erupted during the 18 months an interim military government was&#xA0;in charge in Egypt under the leadership of Field Marshal Hussein&#xA0;Tantawi.</p>
<p>Some prisoners have even been tried since Morsi took&#xA0;office in June. Those already convicted for their role in the protests may also be pardoned.</p>
<p>Mohammed Gadallah, Morsi&#x2019;s legal advisor, said the decree is &#x201C;one of the revolution&#x2019;s most important victories&#x201D;.</p>
<p>&#x201C;It shows the revolution is now in power and guides the decision-making,&#x201D; Gadallah said.</p>
<p>&#x201C;This is a legislation that protects the revolutionaries.&#x201D;</p>
<p><strong>List of names</strong></p>
<p>The decree asks the prosecutor general and the military prosecutor to prepare a list of names of those who may benefit from the pardon.</p>
<p>The first article of the decree, which was published on Morsi&#x2019;s official Facebook page, orders a &#x201C;comprehensive pardon for crimes and misdemeanors or attempts to commit them in support of the revolution and the realization of<br>its goals&#x201D;.</p>
<p>The only suspects exempted from the decree are those charged with premeditated murder over that time period.</p>
<p>Gadallah said the decree is likely to cover all major court cases where protesters clashed with military troops and security forces.</p>
<p>Another human rights lawyer, Ahmed Ragheb, praised Morsi&#x2019;s decree but said it doesn&#x2019;t include &#x201C;all the victims of the past period&#x201D;.</p>
<p>Protesters currently on trial face charges ranging from resisting authorities, damaging public or private property or disrupting public order.</p>
<p>More than a 12,000 civilians have been brought before military tribunals, many of them on charges such as &#x201C;thuggery&#x201D;.</p>
<p>It will be up to the prosecutor general and the military prosecutor to name those who will be pardoned. Suspects who are excluded can challenge the decision, and a judicial panel would be the final arbiter.</p>
<p>Morsi, who hails from the Muslim Brotherhood, said on&#xA0;Saturday he had fallen short of goals he promised to fulfil in&#xA0;his first 100 days in office.</p>
