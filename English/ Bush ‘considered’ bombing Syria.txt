<p>George&#xA0;Bush contemplated ordering a US military strike against a suspected Syrian nuclear facility at Israel&#x2019;s request in 2007, the former US president has reminisced in his memor to be published soon.</p>
<p>Israel eventually destroyed the facility, which Syria denied was for developing a nuclear weapons.</p>
<p>In his memoir, &#x201C;Decision Points&#x201D;, to hit bookstores on Tuesday, Bush&#xA0;says that he received an intelligence report about a &#x201C;suspicious, well-hidden facility in the eastern desert of Syria&#x201D; that looked similar to a nuclear facility at Yongbyon, North Korea.</p>
<p>Shortly afterward, he spoke by phone with Ehud Olmert, then the Israeli prime minister.</p>
<p>&#x201C;George, I&#x2019;m asking you to bomb the compound,&#x201D; Olmert told Bush, according to the book, a copy of which was obtained by the Reuters news agency.</p>
<p>Bush said he discussed options with his national security team. A bombing mission was considered &#x201C;but bombing a sovereign country with no warning or announced justification would create severe blowback,&#x201D; he writes.</p>
<p>A covert raid was discussed, but it was considered too risky to slip a team in and out of Syria undetected.</p>
<p>Bush received an intelligence assessment from then-CIA Director Mike Hayden, who reported that analysts had high confidence the plant housed a nuclear reactor but low confidence of a Syrian nuclear weapons programme.</p>
<p>Bush said he told Olmert, &#x201C;I cannot justify an attack on a sovereign nation unless my intelligence agencies stand up and say it&#x2019;s a weapons programme.&#x201D;</p>
<p><strong>Faulty intelligence</strong></p>
<p>Bush had ordered the US-led invasion of Iraq in 2003 based on intelligence that said Iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction, which were never found.</p>
<p>Olmert was disappointed by Bush&#x2019;s decision to recommend a strategy of using diplomacy backed up by the threat of force to deal with Syria over the facility.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Your strategy is very disturbing to me,&#x201D; Olmert told Bush, according to the book.</p>
<p>Bush denies charges that arose at the time that he had given a &#x201C;green light&#x201D; for Israel to attack the installation.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Prime Minister Olmert hadn&#x2019;t asked for a green light and I hadn&#x2019;t given one. He had done what he believed was necessary to protect Israel,&#x201D; Bush says in the book.</p>
<p>In Jerusalem, Olmert&#x2019;s office declined comment on the disclosures in the Bush memoir.</p>
<p>Israel has&#xA0;never formally confirmed carrying out the sortie or targeting a nuclear facility.</p>
<p>The Olmert government was pursuing indirect peace talks with Syria at the time.</p>
<p>But Olmert, who resigned in a corruption scandal in 2008, has recently lifted the veil, speaking of a &#x201C;daring operation&#x201D; that he ordered despite opposition.</p>
<p>Bush writes that Olmert&#x2019;s &#x201C;execution of the strike&#x201D; against the Syrian compound made up for the confidence he had lost in the Israelis during their 2006 war against Hezbollah in Lebanon, which Bush feels had a mixed outcome.</p>
<p>Lebanon&#x2019;s young democracy emerged from the conflict stronger for having endured the test, Bush says, but &#x201C;the result for Israel was mixed.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Its military campaign weakened Hezbollah and helped secure its border. At the same time, the Israelis&#x2019; shaky military performance cost them international credibility,&#x201D; Bush says.</p>
