<p><strong>&#x2018;Hope and optimism&#x2019;<br></strong><br>&#x201C;As a senator, I will spend two years doing everything in my power to limit the damage George W. Bush can do. But only a new&#xA0;president will be able to undo Bush&#x2019;s mistakes and restore our hope&#xA0;and optimism,&#x201D; Clinton said.</p>

<div style="LINE-HEIGHT:1.2">&#x201C;Let&#x2019;s talk. Let&#x2019;s chat. The conversation in Washington has been just a little one-sided lately, don&#x2019;t you think?&#x201D;</div>

<div style="LINE-HEIGHT:1.2">She said she planned to host live online video&#xA0;conversations with voters&#xA0;from Monday.&#xA0;<p></p>
<p>Clinton would be the first female president if she won the election, and with millions of dollars in the bank, a large network of supporters and strong backing in most polls, she&#xA0;is seen as having a good chance of capturing the White House. </p></div>
<div style="LINE-HEIGHT:1.2"><strong>Following in Bill&#x2019;s footsteps</strong><p></p>
<p>She is also the first wife of a former president to pursue the office. Bill Clinton served two terms in the White House from 1993-2001.</p>
<p>Critics have said that Hillary Clinton lacks the natural charisma of her husband and is overly cautious when many voters say they want authenticity from a candidate.</p>
<p>But her allies counter by citing her strengths &#x2013; intelligence, depth of experience, work ethic and an immense command of policy detail. </p></div>

<div style="LINE-HEIGHT:1.2">Advisers argue those skills, plus her popularity among women and younger voters, position her strongly as both a primary and election candidate.<p></p>
<p>She won a landslide victory when she stood for the Senate for the first time in 2000, despite being criticised for standing in a state where she had never lived.</p>
<p>In the Senate, Clinton has quickly moved to establish herself as someone who can work with Republicans or Democrats, often sponsoring high-profile legislation with Republican colleagues.</p>
<p>Recently, she has toughened her criticism of the conduct of the war in Iraq and Bush&#x2019;s handling of the conflict but her vote for the use of force in 2002 remains a significant political hurdle with some voters.</p></div>
