<p>Turkish President <a href="/topics/people/recep-tayyip-erdogan.html">Recep Tayyip Erdogan</a> has said that the Egyptian government should be tried in international courts for the death of former President <a href="/topics/people/mohamed-morsi.html">Mohamed Morsi.</a></p>
<p>Morsi, a leading member of the Muslim Brotherhood group which is now banned in Egypt, died on Monday after collapsing in a Cairo court while on trial on espionage charges.</p>
<p><a href="/topics/country/egypt.html">Egypt</a>&#x2018;s first freely elected president was deposed in a 2013 coup orchestrated by the current President <a href="/topics/people/abdel-fattah-el-sisi.html">Abdel Fattah el-Sisi </a>and placed under house arrest before being moved to prison.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Mohamed Morsi flailed on the courtroom floor for 20 minutes and the authorities did not help him. This is why I say Morsi did not die, he was murdered,&#x201D; Erdogan told supporters on Wednesday at an election rally in Istanbul.</p>

<p>&#x201C;We, as Turkey, will follow this issue and do everything possible for Egypt to be tried in international courts for Morsi&#x2019;s death,&#x201D; he said, calling on the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation to take action towards this end.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, the UN called for a &#x201C;thorough and transparent investigation&#x201D; into the death of Morsi, drawing criticism from Egypt, which accused the UN of seeking to &#x201C;politicise&#x201D; his death.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Any sudden death in custody must be followed by a prompt, impartial, thorough and transparent investigation carried out by an independent body to clarify the cause of death,&#x201D; Rupert Colville, spokesman for the UN high commissioner for human rights, said.</p>
<p>Earlier, the Turkish leader called Morsi a &#x201C;martyr&#x201D; adding that he did not believe the former president died due to natural causes.</p>

<p>Erdogan&#x2019;s Islamist-rooted AK Party supported Morsi&#x2019;s short-lived Egyptian government, and many Brotherhood members and supporters have fled to Turkey since its activities were banned in Egypt.</p>
<p>The Turkish leader added he would raise the issue at the G20 summit in Japan at the end of the month.</p>
<p>The attorney general&#x2019;s office in Egypt has said that Morsi was &#x201C;transported immediately to the hospital&#x201D;, where medics pronounced him dead. Cairo has dismissed accusations that he was badly treated.</p>
<p>Morsi was buried on Tuesday in Cairo, as rights groups including Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch called for an independent probe into the causes of his death.</p>
<p>Erdogan on Tuesday joined a prayer session at an Istanbul mosque for the former Egyptian leader, while thousands of people across the Middle East paid their respects to the former president.</p>
<p>The Turkish president also denounced the Egyptian authorities for burying Morsi discreetly, with only a small number of family members and confidants present.</p>
<p>Journalists were kept away from the burial service in Cairo, while a family request to bury him in his home town was turned down.</p>
