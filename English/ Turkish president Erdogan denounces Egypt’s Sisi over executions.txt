<p>Turkish President <a href="/indepth/spotlight/turkeyelection/2011/05/2011526121054590355.html">Recep Tayyip Erdogan</a> sharply criticised his Egyptian counterpart Abdel Fattah el-Sisi after the recent execution of nine people in <a href="/topics/country/egypt.html">Egypt</a>, saying he refused to talk to &#x201C;someone like him&#x201D;.</p>
<p>&#x201C;They killed nine young people recently. This is not something we can accept,&#x201D; Erdogan said on Saturday in an interview with Turkish TV channels CNN-Turk and Kanal D, referring to the <a href="/news/2019/02/egypt-executes-2015-murder-prosecutor-hisham-barakat-190220114015671.html">execution</a>&#xA0;on Wednesday of men sentenced for the murder of the Egyptian prosecutor general in 2015.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Of course, we are going to be told that it is a decision of the judiciary, but there, justice, elections, all that, are nonsense. There is an authoritarian system, even totalitarian,&#x201D; Erdogan added.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Now, I am answering those who wonder why Tayyip Erdogan does not speak to Sisi, because there are mediators who come here sometimes, but I will never talk to someone like him,&#x201D; he said.</p>

<p>Relations between <a href="/topics/country/turkey.html">Turkey</a> and Egypt have been virtually non-existent since the Egyptian military, then led by Sisi, overthrew democratically elected President <a href="/news/2016/06/profile-egypt-deposed-president-mohamed-morsi-160607074148919.html">Mohamed Morsi</a> in 2013 &#x2013; a close ally of Erdogan.</p>
<p>Hundreds of Morsi supporters have been sentenced to death, while Morsi and top <a href="/indepth/features/2017/06/muslim-brotherhood-explained-170608091709865.html">Muslim Brotherhood</a> figures have also faced trial.</p>
<p>Egypt outlawed the Muslim Brotherhood and branded it a terrorist organisation in December 2013, just months after Morsi&#x2019;s removal.</p>
<p>Many of the death sentences have been handed down at mass trials involving hundreds of defendants and lasting just days.</p>
<p>The Turkish president called for the release of Muslim Brotherhood prisoners in Egypt.</p>
<p>&#x201C;First of all, he should release all those imprisoned with a general amnesty. As long as these people have not been released, we will not be able to talk with Sisi,&#x201D; he said.</p>
<p>Erdogan also attacked Western countries which, he said, &#x201C;roll out the red carpet&#x201D; for Sisi and turn a blind eye to the latest executions in Egypt.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Where are the Westerners? Have you heard their voices?&#x201D; he said.</p>
<p>&#x201C;On the other hand, when it comes to people imprisoned in our country (Turkey), they scream bloody murder.&#x201D;</p>
<p><a href="/topics/organisations/amnesty-international.html">Amnesty International</a> condemned the executions of the nine men, who it said were convicted in trials marred by torture allegations.</p>
<p>The comments come as Arab and European leaders convene in Egypt&#x2019;s Red Sea resort city of Sharm el-Sheikh for the first EU-Arab League summit on Sunday.&#xA0;</p>
<h2>Syria&#x2019;s &#x2018;safe zone&#x2019;</h2>
<p>Erdogan also said a <a href="/news/2019/02/erdogan-satisfactory-plan-syria-safe-zone-190205104022357.html">safe zone</a> along the <a href="/topics/subjects/turkey-syria-border.html">Turkey-Syria border</a> should be under Turkey&#x2019;s control.</p>
<p>In the televised interview, Erdogan said Turkey is the first country to be affected by the heavy gunfire.</p>
<p>&#x201C;I will take my precaution in the opposite country,&#x201D; he said.</p>
<p>The Turkish president said a peaceful and stabilised environment in Syria&#x2019;s Afrin, Jarablus and al-Bab provinces should be sustained in border regions.</p>
<p>Ankara wants to set up a safe zone with logistical support from allies and says it should be cleared of the US-backed Kurdish YPG militia, which Ankara considers a &#x201C;terrorist&#x201D; group tied to the outlawed <a href="/topics/organisations/pkk.html">Kurdistan Workers&#x2019; Party</a> inside its own borders.</p>
<p>&#x201C;It is important for us that the US decision to withdraw from <a href="/topics/country/syria.html">Syria</a> does not lead to developments against the interests of our countries and Syria&#x2019;s political unity and territorial integrity,&#x201D; Erdogan said, adding that a vacuum after the withdrawal to be replaced by &#x201C;terrorist&#x201D; groups is unacceptable.</p>
<p>Last December, Trump made a surprise announcement that the US would be withdrawing all of its troops from Syria and said <a href="/topics/organisations/isis-isil.html">ISIL</a> had been defeated in the country.</p>
<p>Critics have decried a number of possible outcomes from a precipitous withdrawal, including a Turkish attack on Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces, Washington&#x2019;s main ally in the fight against ISIL, as well as a resurgence of the armed group.</p>
