<p>An Egyptian researcher and activist has been arrested at Cairo&#x2019;s international airport upon his arrival from Italy, in a move that raised alarm and prompted condemnation by human rights groups.</p>
<p>Patrick George Zaki, 27, had been in Bologna since August 2019 for his postgraduate studies and returned to Egypt&#x2019;s capital for a brief family visit on Friday,&#xA0;according to the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights (EIPR).</p>
<p>It said Zaki, who works as a gender and human rights researcher for the group, was taken into custody at the airport and disappeared for 24 hours.</p>
<p>Zaki&#x2019;s lawyers said he was beaten, subjected to electric shocks, threatened and questioned about his work and activism before he appeared at a public prosecutor&#x2019;s office in his hometown, the Nile Delta city of Mansoura, on Saturday, according to&#xA0;EIPR.</p>
<p>Prosecutors ordered that he remain in custody for 15 days pending investigations into a host of allegations, including publishing false news, inciting protests without permission and calling for the overthrow of the state.&#xA0;</p>
<p>Other allegations included managing a social media account that aims to undermine the social order and public safety, and incitement to commit violence and terrorist crimes,&#xA0;EIPR&#xA0;said.</p>
<p>&#x201C;EIPR demands the immediate release of Patrick George Zaki and an end to continued harassment and arbitrary detention of human rights professionals, members of civil society groups and journalists,&#x201D; the group said in a&#xA0;<a href="https://eipr.org/en/press/2020/02/egyptian-human-rights-defender-disappeared-and-tortured-eipr-gender-rights-0" target="_blank">statement</a>&#xA0;published on its website.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Interior, which oversees Egypt&#x2019;s police, said in a brief statement on Sunday that Zaki was being held on a warrant from the prosecution, who ordered him to remain in detention pending an investigation.</p>
<h2>Thousands arrested</h2>
<p>Rights activists say President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi has overseen an unprecedented crackdown on freedoms in Egypt since first taking power in 2013 and then winning elections in 2014. El-Sisi and his backers say the measures are needed to keep Egypt stable and counter threats from armed groups.</p>
<p>Thousands of people have been arrested &#x2013; both secular-leaning activists and members of the Muslim Brotherhood &#x2013; all while rolling back freedoms won after the uprising in 2011 that became known as the Arab Spring.</p>
<p>Egypt outlawed all unauthorised protests in 2013, months after el-Sisi led the military&#x2019;s removal of the country&#x2019;s first democratically elected president, Mohammed Morsi, following mass protests.</p>
<p>Commenting on Zaki&#x2019;s arrest, a spokesman for Amnesty International Italy told Al Jazeera: &#x201C;The fact that they started with 15 days of pre-trial detention makes us worried about how long this is going to last.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Riccardo Noury added: &#x201C;It could go on for months to then get to an unfair trial with a heavy sentence,&#x201D; he added.</p>
<p>Meanwhile,&#xA0;Italy&#x2019;s ANSA news agency quoted sources as saying that Italian Foreign Minister Luigi di Maio &#x201C;is closely following the case through the embassy in Cairo&#x201D;.&#xA0;</p>
<p>Zaki&#x2019;s arrest has stoked fears of a repeat of the case of the <a href="http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2016/2/4/body-of-italian-student-shows-evidence-of-torture-say-egyptian-officials.html">murder of Giulio Regeni</a>, a 28-year-old PhD student who was disappeared killed in Cairo in January 2016.</p>
<p>Despite months of cooperation between Egyptian and Italian prosecutors, no one has been arrested or charged over the killing. Italy is pressing Egypt to speed up the investigation.</p>
<p>Regeni&#x2019;s body was found, several days after he was killed, <a href="/indepth/features/2017/01/killed-giulio-regeni-170129080239822.html">bearing signs of extensive torture</a>&#xA0;which activists and rights groups say is common in Egyptian detention facilities.</p>
<p>Egyptian authorities have denied involvement in his death and initially suggested Regeni died in a traffic accident. They later said he was killed by a criminal gang that was subsequently wiped out in a shoot-out with police.</p>
<p>&#x201C;How do you still consider Egypt a safe country?&#x201D;&#xA0;Erasmo Palazzotto, president of the parliamentary inquiry into the death of Regeni, <a href="https://twitter.com/EPalazzotto/status/1226189760697376768" target="_blank">said</a> in a Twitter post.</p>
<p>&#x201C;The Italian government cannot keep acting like nothing happened in its relationship to a country that continues to violate human rights in this way,&#x201D; he added.&#xA0;</p>
