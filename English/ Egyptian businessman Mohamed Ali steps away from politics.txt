<p>A former Egyptian army contractor whose online videos last year inspired rare street protests against President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi has said he will step back from politics after his calls for mass anti-government rallies on the ninth anniversary of Egypt&#x2019;s 25th January 2011 uprising &#x201C;failed&#x201D;.</p>
<p>Mohamed Ali, who has <a href="/ajimpact/egyptian-contractor-targeted-sisi-allegations-190905135843139.html">accused the president</a> and the military of corruption, said <span>in a video statement on Saturday&#xA0;</span>that he will also close his Facebook page as there will no longer be use for it.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Today was a turning point for me. I showed you [Egyptians] the type of corruption and arrest campaigns that have been taking place,&#x201D; Ali, who lives in self-imposed exile in Spain, said in the video.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Talking about this any longer is unnecessary.&#x201D;</p>
<h2>&#x2018;Biggest crackdown&#x2019;</h2>
<p>Ali said the lack of response to his latest call pointed either to the Egyptian people&#x2019;s satisfaction with the current government or high levels of fear over possible repercussions.</p>

<p>In a rare show of dissent, thousands of people rallied in cities across Egypt in September last year, demanding the resignation of el-Sisi following a call for protests by Ali, an actor and businessman who says his company used to carry out projects for the Egyptian military.</p>
<p>In response, authorities launched the &#x201C;biggest crackdown&#x201D; under el-Sisi&#x2019;s rule, according to Amnesty International, <a href="/news/2019/10/egypt-thousands-arrested-biggest-crackdown-el-sisi-191002174627211.html">rounding up more than 2,300 people</a>.</p>
<p>Arabic media on Saturday reported that security forces were deployed across the capital, Cairo, and several other major cities in anticipation of possible protests.</p>
<p>Egypt outlawed all unauthorised demonstrations in 2013 after el-Sisi, as defence minister, led the military&#x2019;s overthrow of democratically-elected President Mohamed Morsi&#xA0;following mass demonstrations.</p>
<p>Since then, Egyptian authorities have imprisoned and prosecuted thousands of people, according to human rights groups, with a nationwide crackdown intensifying after el-Sisi was first elected&#xA0;in 2014 with 97 percent of the vote.</p>
<p>Some Egyptian activists have warned of the danger protesting poses to the lives of demonstrators, given what they called a tight grip on security by authorities.</p>
<p><span>On January 25, 2011, the Egyptian people began their revolution that toppled longtime President Hosni Mubarak.</span></p>
