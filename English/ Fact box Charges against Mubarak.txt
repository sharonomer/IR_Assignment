<p>Ousted Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and his two sons have pleaded not guilty to charges of murder and corruption&#xA0;during&#xA0;the opening of an historic trial&#xA0;on Wednesday in Cairo.</p>
<p>The Mubaraks are being tried along with the&#xA0;former interior minister, Habib al-Adly, and six&#xA0;former high-ranking security chiefs, nearly six months after the government was toppled in an 18-day popular uprising.</p>
<p>A business executive and Mubarak confidant, Hussein Salem, has reportedly been arrested in Spain and is being tried in absentia.</p>
<p>The charges against them are as follows:</p>

<p>Accused of conspiring in the premeditated and attempted murder of protesters during the uprising, abusing power to amass wealth, and allowing below-market price gas sales to Israel.</p>
<p>If convicted, Mubarak could face the death penalty.</p>
<p>Mubarak has been under arrest for several months in a hospital in the Red Sea resort town of Sharm el-Sheikh after allegedly suffering a heart attack. His lawyer, Farid el-Deeb,&#xA0;also says he has cancer.</p>
<p>Deeb has argued&#xA0;that Mubarak did not sanction the brutal crackdown on protesters that left more than 850 people dead and thousands injured.</p>
