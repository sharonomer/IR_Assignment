<p>In an unusually rapid prosecution, Talaat Sadat, 52, was convicted on Tuesday of defaming the Egyptian armed forces for saying in a television interview earlier this month that unnamed generals had masterminded his uncle&#x2019;s assassination in 1981.</p>
<p>Within minutes of the sentencing, Sadat&#x2019;s supporters shouted outside the court: &#x201C;This is injustice!&#x201D; &#x201C;This is unlawful!&#x201D;</p>
<p>Sadat is the second prominent political opponent of the government to be sentenced to prison within 12 months. Last December, Ayman Nour, the leading challenger in last year&#x2019;s presidential elections, was sentenced to five years&#x2019; imprisonment for forgery after a trial that was internationally regarded as failing to meet standards of due process.</p>
<p>An outspoken legislator and a lawyer, Talaat Sadat had accused the government of prosecuting him for political reasons. The US State Department had criticised his prosecution, saying it was concerned that it violated freedom of expression.</p>

<p>Sadat was taken into custody immediately after the verdict, said his aide, Mohsen Eid.</p>

<p>Egyptian newspapers have been instructed not to report his trial.</p>
<p>There is no appeal against military court verdicts. Sadat&#x2019;s only option is to appeal to Hosni Mubarak, the president. </p>
<p>Sadat had pleaded innocent to charges of &#x201C;spreading false rumours and insulting the armed forces&#x201D;.</p>
<p>In an interview broadcast on October 4, Sadat said there had been an international conspiracy to assassinate his uncle, and the conspirators included some of Anwar Sadat&#x2019;s personal guards, Egyptian generals, as well as the US and Israel.</p>
<p>&#x201C;No one from the special personal protection group of the late president fired a single shot during the killing, and not one of them has been put on trial,&#x201D; Sadat told the Saudi TV channel Orbit.</p>
<p>The day after the broadcast, Sadat was stripped of his parliamentary immunity and his trial began on October 11. The parliament will be instructed to drop Sadat&#x2019;s membership, Egypt&#x2019;s official news agency reported later on Tuesday.</p>
<p>President Sadat was shot dead by hardliners in the Egyptian army during a military parade in Cairo on October 6, 1981. The soldiers were opposed to Sadat&#x2019;s landmark peace treaty with Israel of 1979.</p>
