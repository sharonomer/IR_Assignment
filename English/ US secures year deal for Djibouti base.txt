<p><span>The United States has secured a ten-year lease for a key military base in Djibouti that it relies on to launch &#x201C;counter-terrorism&#x201D; missions, including drone strikes, in Yemen and the Horn of Africa.</span></p>
<p><span>US President Barack Obama and his Djibouti counterpart Ismail Omar Guelleh announced the renewed lease on Camp Lemonnier on Monday as they met at the White House, pledging to counter al-Qaeda and al-Shabab fighters in the region. </span></p>
<p><span>Under the agreement, the&#xA0;Washington would pay $63m annually for a ten-year lease, with an option to extend the arrangement for another decade, administration officials said. </span></p>
<p><span>The new deal represents a major increase in rent, as the US reportedly pays $38m a year under the current lease.</span></p>
<p><span>&#x201C;Camp Lemonnier is extraordinarily important to our work throughout the Horn of Africa but also throughout the region. We very much appreciate the hospitality that Djiboutians provide,&#x201D; Obama said.</span></p>
<p><span>&#x201C;Overall, this is a critical facility that we maintain in Djibouti, we could not do it without the president&#x2019;s co-operation, we&#x2019;re grateful for him agreeing for a long-term presence there.&#x201D;</span></p>
<p><span>Djibouti, a tiny nation of less than&#xA0;one million people, has become essential to&#xA0;US&#xA0;operations in Africa and the Middle East. </span></p>
<p><span>Camp Lemonnier houses conventional forces, as well as special forces and aerial drones flown over Yemen and Somalia.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>&#x2018;Strategic partnership&#x2019;</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Guelleh said his East African country and the US were linked in a &#x201C;strategic partnership&#x201D; to deal with &#x201C;the fight against terrorism, piracy and human trafficking in our region.&#x201D;</span></p>
<p><span>Obama also promised more US assistance and equipment for Djibouti&#x2019;s forces, including for troops deploying to the African Union mission in Somalia.</span></p>
<p><span>More US development aid for Djibouti&#x2019;s economy, including help improving the country&#x2019;s electricity network, was also pledged.</span></p>
<p><span>After al-Qaeda&#x2019;s attacks on US soil on September 11, 2001,&#xA0;the US&#xA0;presence has steadily increased.</span></p>
<p><span>US officials, anxious to maintain a low-profile for&#xA0;its military in Africa, tend to disclose few details about operations at the base.</span></p>
<p><span>The Pentagon reportedly has informed Congress of plans for a dramatic expansion of its facilities in Djibouti, proposing more than&#xA0;$1bn in construction projects.<br></span></p>
