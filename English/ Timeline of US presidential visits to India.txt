<p><strong>New Delhi, India &#x2013;</strong> Donald Trump has embarked on his maiden visit to India becoming the seventh US president to visit the South Asian country.</p>
<p>He is accompanied by a high-level delegation, as well as his wife First Lady Melania Trump, daughter Ivanka Trump, and son-in-law Jared Kushner.</p>
<p>Trump arrived on Monday in Ahmedabad, the largest city in the western state of Gujarat, where he addressed a crowd of more than 100,000 Indians at a cricket stadium.</p>
<p>The event was called &#x201C;Namaste Trump&#x201D; (Hello Trump), in reciprocation to the &#x201C;Howdy Modi&#x201D; extravaganza Trump hosted last year for the Indian PM in the US city of Houston.</p>
<p>Ties between the two countries have improved greatly after the end of the Cold War, during which Washington leaned towards India&#x2019;s rival, Pakistan, but has embraced India as a strategic partner against China in recent decades.</p>
<p>Barack Obama, Trump&#x2019;s predecessor, is the only US president to have made two official visits to India.</p>
<p>We take a look at previous visits by the US presidents:</p>
<h2>Dwight D Eisenhower &#x2013; 1959</h2>
<p>Dwight D Eisenhower in 1959 was the first US president to visit India. His visit was during the tenure of the country&#x2019;s first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru.</p>
<p>Eisenhower received a warm welcome and was greeted with a 21-gun salute when he landed in the capital, New Delhi. Huge crowds lined the streets to catch a glimpse of the 34th US president in his open-top car.</p>

<p>Besides delivering a public speech at New Delhi&#x2019;s Ramlila ground, Eisenhower addressed members of both Houses of Parliament. The four-day trip included a stopover in his &#x201C;dream place&#x201D;, the Taj Mahal, which was built by Mughal ruler Shah Jahan in the 16th century.</p>
<p>The trip was billed a success and considered a landmark event in US-India relations as it came early in the Cold War, during which the US and Pakistan had become close allies.</p>
<h2>Richard M Nixon &#x2013; 1969</h2>
<p>Richard M Nixon visited India on July 31, 1969. Unlike Eisenhower, Nixon spent less than a day in India as the trip was largely meant to reduce tensions between him and then-Prime Minister Indira Gandhi.</p>
<p>Two years later, during the India and Pakistan war of 1971, which lead to the creation of Bangladesh, the US sided with its Cold War ally, Pakistan.</p>

<p>According to tapes declassified by the US State Department, Nixon had reportedly told the White House that Indians were &#x201C;slippery, treacherous people&#x201D;.</p>
<h2>Jimmy Carter &#x2013; 1978</h2>
<p>Jimmy Carter came to India in January 1978, when the Janata Party&#x2019;s Morarji Desai was the prime minister.</p>
<p>During his three-day visit, Carter addressed India&#x2019;s parliament and held several meetings with Indian politicians. Carter visited a village near New Delhi, bringing a television set as a gift.</p>
<p>His visit was meant to break the ice between New Delhi and Washington, especially against the backdrop of the 1971 Bangladesh War of Independence and India&#x2019;s nuclear test of 1974.</p>
<p>However, he was not able to convince Prime Minister Desai to give up India&#x2019;s nuclear ambitions, a development that irritated the US.</p>

<h2>Bill Clinton &#x2013; 2000</h2>
<p>Bill Clinton, the 42nd US president, visited India in March 2000, more than two decades after the last visit by a US president.</p>
<p>His trip during the prime ministership of Atal Bihari Vajpayee came after a prolonged lull in the relations between the two countries. It also came after India opened its economy for foreign investors in the 1990s.</p>
<p>Clinton&#x2019;s visit signified the beginning of closer US-India strategic and economic ties. During the 1999 war between Pakistan and India, the US under Clinton sided with India, the first time it had supported India against Pakistan.</p>
<p>New Delhi-based foreign policy expert Pramit Pal Chaudhuri said it was President Clinton who restarted India-US relations.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Before Clinton, no US president had visited India for 20 years. Clinton in many ways re-engaged with India after two decades, signalling that America was taking India seriously one more time for number of reasons; nuclear test, economic growth and so on,&#x201D; he said.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Bush took it to the highest possible levels with a nuclear deal and Obama consolidated on the strategic side,&#x201D; said Chaudhuri, who is also the foreign editor at Hindustan Times newspaper.</p>

<h2>George W Bush &#x2013; 2006</h2>
<p>George W Bush visited New Delhi in 2006 when the US was being condemned worldwide for its 2003 invasion of Iraq. His trip was met with countrywide protests, with left-wing parliamentarians boycotting his address.</p>
<p>However, the three-day trip boosted the strategic relationship between the two countries, especially in matters of trade and nuclear technology. Bush and then-Prime Minister Manmohan Singh finalised the framework of the nuclear deal that ended New Delhi&#x2019;s isolation from the nuclear equipment suppliers market.</p>

</div>
<p>Michael Kugelman, South Asia senior associate at The Wilson Center, said the US-India relationship improved exponentially since the early 1990s, and especially since the early 2000s.</p>
<p>&#x201C;The civil nuclear accord [under President Bush] was a milestone and, from that point, the relationship has really taken off -though it has also been saddled by outsize and unmet expectations.&#x201D;</p>
<h2>Barack Obama &#x2013; 2010 and 2015</h2>
<p>Barack Obama is the only US president to make two official visits to India. On his first visit, Obama landed in Mumbai instead of New Delhi as a show of solidarity following the Mumbai terror attacks of 2008, which killed 166 people.</p>
<p>During the trip, he backed India&#x2019;s bid for a permanent seat in the UN Security Council. Obama and Singh, prime minister at the time, also signed trade deals worth $10bn and agreed to boost defence and national security ties.</p>

</div>
<p>Obama visited India again in 2015 as the chief guest on Republic Day under the administration of Prime Minister Modi.</p>
<p>During the trip, the Democratic president made comments on religious freedom in the country, saying &#x201C;India will succeed so long as it is not splintered along the lines of religious faith&#x201D;.</p>
<h2>Donald Trump &#x2013; 2020</h2>
<p>Donald Trump is the seventh US president to visit India, where he was given a warm welcome.</p>
<p>A personal rapport has developed between Indian Prime Minister Modi and Trump, both of whom have used the theatrics of diplomacy to strike a chord with their respective domestic audiences.</p>
<p>Both right-wing leaders have been criticized for pursuing an Islamophobic agenda &#x2013; Trump for his Muslim ban and Modi for blocking naturalisation for Muslim immigrants and asylum seekers.</p>
<p>The US is India&#x2019;s second-largest trading partner after China, with annual bilateral trade going from $11bn in 1995 to $142bn in 2018, according to official US data. But the two countries have been wrangling over a trade deal as Trump pushed for more concessions from New Delhi.&#xA0;</p>

<p>&#x201C;To be sure, the main focus of this trip will be on all the spectacle and on all the strong chemistry between Trump and Modi. But there&#x2019;s a strategic dimension to it as well,&#x201D; said Kugelman from The Wilson Center.</p>
<p>Foreign policy expert Chaudhuri said &#x201C;Trump&#x2019;s visit has been a missing piece in Modi&#x2019;s foreign policy&#x201D; and this visit has &#x201C;fulfilled that space&#x201D;.</p>
<p>He said that by coming to India despite the fact that there is not going to be a trade deal, Trump signals to the rest of the US government that &#x201C;he takes the US-India relationship seriously and he expects them to move forward on the other issues be it defence and diplomacy.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Safiya Ghori Ahmad, South Asia director at Washington, DC-based McLarty Associates said it would interesting to see &#x201C;the deliverables&#x201D; from the trip.</p>
<p>&#x201C;I do hope that we see more than a rally, and actually see solutions to long-standing economic issues that impact US companies,&#x201D; Ahmad said.</p>
