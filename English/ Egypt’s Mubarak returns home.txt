<p>Mubarak, who has ruled Egypt for almost three decades, underwent surgery on March 6.</p>
<p>An official told the Reuters news agency&#xA0;the president would reassume presidential powers on his return.</p>
<p>He&#xA0;handed presidential powers to Ahmed Nazif, the&#xA0;prime minister, just before the operation, although he has been shown speaking on the telephone with foreign leaders and local officials while at the hospital.</p>
<p>As with other occasions when he has&#xA0;received medical treatment, the latest incident sparked rumours about his&#xA0;health. It led to Egypt&#x2019;s stock market falling sharply in the days after the president&#x2019;s operation.</p>
<p>However, it&#xA0;steadied when images of him sitting and chatting with doctors were broadcast on March 16.</p>
<p>Mubarak has not said whether he plans to run for a sixth six-year term in a presidential&#xA0;election due in 2011.</p>
