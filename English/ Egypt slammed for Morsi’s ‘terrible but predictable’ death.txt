<p>A human rights group says the Egyptian government bears responsibility for the&#xA0;<a href="/news/2019/06/egypt-president-mohamed-morsi-dies-state-media-190617155322012.html">death</a> of former Egyptian President <a href="/topics/people/mohamed-morsi.html">Mohamed Morsi</a>, amid pressing international demands for a fair and transparent investigation into the circumstances surrounding his final hours.</p>
<p>According to authorities, the first democratically elected president in <a href="/topics/country/egypt.html">Egypt</a>&#x2018;s modern history died on Monday after collapsing in a court in Cairo while on trial on espionage charges. The Egyptian public prosecutor said a medical report showed no apparent recent injuries on Morsi&#x2019;s body.</p>
<p><span>The 67-year-old, who&#xA0;<span>had been behind bars for nearly six years after his overthrow in a military coup in 2013,</span>&#xA0;had a long history of health issues, including suffering from diabetes, as well as liver and kidney disease.</span></p>
<p><span> Rights groups and international observers had long decried the medical neglect Morsi was suffering during his &#x201C;harsh&#x201D; imprisonment, i</span>ncluding years of solitary confinement.</p>
<p>&#x201C;The government of Egypt today bears responsibility for his death, given their failure to provide him with adequate medical care or basic prisoner rights,&#x201D; <a href="/topics/organisations/human-rights-watch.html">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) said in a statement to Al Jazeera.</p>
<p>&#x201C;He&#x2019;s been in prison and treated worse than the already terrible conditions for Egypt&#x2019;s prisoners,&#x201D;&#xA0;<span>Sarah Leah Whitson,&#xA0;executive director of the HRW&#x2019;s Middle East and North Africa division, told Al Jazeera, decrying&#xA0;<span>Morsi&#x2019;s &#x201C;terrible but entirely predictable&#x201D; death.</span></span></p>
<p>&#x201C;The Egyptian government has known very clearly about his declining medical state. He had lost a great deal of weight, he had fainted in court a number of times and was being kept in almost around-the-clock solitary confinement.&#x201D;</p>

<p>HRW&#x2019;s statement echoed a <a href="https://www.detentionreview.com/drpreport/" target="_parent">report </a>released in March 2018 by a<span>&#xA0;panel of British members of parliament and lawyers,</span>&#xA0;which warned that the lack of medical treatment could result in Morsi&#x2019;s &#x201C;premature death&#x201D;.</p>
<div class="inpage-embed article-guid" data-guid="190617155322012">
<div style="display:none">190617155322012</div>
</div>
<p>&#x201C;Our conclusions are stark,&#x201D; Crispin Blunt, chairman <span>of the Independent Detention Review Panel,</span>&#xA0;said at the time.</p>
<p>&#x201C;The denial of basic medical treatment to which he is entitled could lead to his premature death,&#x201D; he added.</p>
<p>&#x201C;The whole overseeing chain of command up to the current president would have responsibility for this.&#x201D;</p>
<p>The members of the panel were denied access by Egyptian authorities to visit Morsi, and relied on testimonies, witness statements, NGO reports and independently submitted evidence.</p>
<p>They said that Morsi was being kept in solitary confinement for 23 hours a day, which would be classified as torture under UN guidelines.</p>
<p>&#x201C;He has been held under conditions that we found on the balance of probability was actually so bad &#x2013; in terms of how degrading they were and how tough they were for him &#x2013; that they could amount to torture,&#x201D; Blunt told Al Jazeera on Monday.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Torture is a crime of universal jurisdiction. And we found that the responsibility for that would sit all the way up the Egyptian chain of command,&#x201D; he added. &#x201C;So, if they had looked after him since our report, then it would be in Egypt&#x2019;s own interest to establish [an independent inquiry].&#x201D;&#xA0;</p>
<p>Also on Monday, <a href="/topics/organisations/amnesty-international.html">Amnesty International</a> urged the Egyptian authorities &#x201C;to conduct an impartial, thorough and transparent investigation into the circumstances of Morsi&#x2019;s death, including his solitary confinement and isolation from the outside world&#x201D;</p>
<p>It also called for a probe into the medical care Morsi was receiving, and for anyone found responsible for mistreatment to be held accountable.</p>
<h2>&#x2018;Unlawful isolation&#x2019;</h2>
<p>The calls came two years after the HRW <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/06/19/egypt-morsys-isolation-violates-rights">reported</a> that Egyptian authorities had unlawfully isolated Morsi, preventing him from contacting or receiving visits from his family and lawyers since the military coup in 2013.</p>
<p>On June 4, 2017, Egyptian authorities allowed Morsi to receive visits from his family and lawyer for only the second time in nearly four years, according to the HRW.</p>
<p>These conditions undermined Morsi&#x2019;s right &#x201C;to mount a legal challenge to his detention and a defence against the many prosecutions filed against him&#x201D; and may have contributed to a decline in his health, HRW noted.</p>

<p>&#x201C;Morsi&#x2019;s treatment is a window into the appalling conditions suffered by thousands of political detainees in Egypt,&#x201D; Joe Stork, HRW&#x2019;s deputy director of Middle East and North Africa, said at the time.</p>
<p>According to the report, during the first week of June in 2017, Morsi fainted twice and experienced a diabetic coma.</p>
<p>A relative of Morsi told HRW in 2015 that a prison nurse or doctor usually checks the former president&#x2019;s blood pressure and sugar level every few days but provided no other <a href="/topics/subjects/healthcare.html">healthcare</a>.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The relative said the authorities had never allowed the family to deliver any food or medicine &#x2013; as most relatives of prisoners do to supplement the often dangerously meagre provisions in Egyptian prisons &#x2013; and that Morsi had been buying his own insulin using money deposited by his family.</p>
<p>The authorities had also denied Morsi any access to newspapers, television and phone calls, the relative added.</p>
<p>In October 2018, Morsi&#x2019;s son, Abdullah, was <a href="/news/2018/10/son-egypt-president-mohamed-morsi-arrested-cairo-181010142640453.html">arrested</a> days after he told The Associated Press news agency in an interview that his father&#x2019;s health had deteriorated due to prison conditions and that the family was rarely allowed to visit.</p>
<p>Abdullah said he was seeking more visitation rights and better healthcare for his ailing father.</p>
