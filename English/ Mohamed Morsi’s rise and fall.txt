<p><strong>Cairo, Egypt &#x2013;</strong> After decades of being an underground group, Egypt&#x2019;s Muslim Brotherhood finally got its chance to realise its dream of mainstream appeal, and rise to power through the country&#x2019;s first presidential elections, which followed&#xA0;the 2011 toppling of Hosni Mubarak.</p>
<p>The Brotherhood&#x2019;s Mohamed Morsi, who was not initially the group&#x2019;s preferred presidential candidate, narrowly won a run-off vote against Ahmed Shafiq, a former Mubarak aide.</p>
<p>Seen by many voters as the better of two bad options, Morsi managed to secure a fraction more than half of the total votes, and was the republic&#x2019;s first elected civilian president.</p>
<p>So far, luck was on his side. He had managed to escape from prison, where he had been held during the revolution, and was now running the country.</p>
<p>He was quick to forget, however, that many &#x2013; including those who supported him in the race &#x2013; were hungry for change.</p>
<p>One eventful year into his four-year tenure, Morsi&#x2019;s rule was shattered beneath the feet of millions who took to the streets demanding his resignation.</p>
<p>With the army&#x2019;s backing, the Brotherhood&#x2019;s dream was short-lived. On Wednesday, Morsi will stand trial over the jailbreak that freed him, as well as accusations of killing protesters and collaborating with Hamas and Hezbollah to carry out &#x201C;terrorist conspiracies&#x201D; against Egypt.</p>
<p>He could face the death penalty over the charges.</p>
