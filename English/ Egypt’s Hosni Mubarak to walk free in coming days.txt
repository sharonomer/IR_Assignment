<p><a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/topics/people/hosni-mubarak.html">Hosni Mubarak</a>, who was overthrown as president of<a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/egypt.html"> Egypt</a> in an uprising in 2011, will be released from detention in a military hospital after a six-year legal battle over accusations of involvement in the killing of protesters.&#xA0;</p>
<p>&#x201C;He will go to his home in Heliopolis,&#x201D; Mubarak&#x2019;s lawyer Farid el-Deeb said, adding the ageing former president would likely be released on Tuesday or soon after, but would be barred from leaving the country pending an ongoing <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/topics/issues/corruption.html">corruption</a> investigation.&#xA0;</p>
<p><span>The prosecutor&#x2019;s decision came on Monday, days after an appeals court acquitted Mubarak on March 2 of involvement in the killing of protesters during the 2011 uprising that ousted him.</span></p>

<p>His acquittal, which is final, has angered relatives of those killed in 2011.</p>
<p><span>&#x201C;Our son&#x2019;s blood was spilled for nothing,&#x201D; said Mostafa Morsi, whose son was shot dead aged 22 on January 28, 2011.</span></p>
<p>The president who ruled for 30 years was accused of inciting the deaths of protesters during the 18-day revolt, in which about 850 people were killed as police clashed with demonstrators.</p>
<p>Mubarak, 88, was sentenced to life in 2012, but an appeals court ordered a retrial, which dismissed the charges two years later.</p>
<p><span>Amid public anger, prosecutors had levelled various charges against Mubarak following his February 2011 resignation.</span></p>
<p>In January 2016, the appeals court upheld a three-year prison sentence for Mubarak and his two sons on corruption charges.</p>
<p>But the sentence took into account time served. Both of his sons, Alaa and Gamal, were freed.</p>
<p>Six years after his overthrow, most of the charges brought against his regime members have been dismissed while the country struggles to recover from the aftermath of the uprising.</p>
<p>The revolt ushered in instability that drove away tourists and investors, taking a heavy toll on the economy.</p>
<p>Mubarak&#x2019;s elected <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/topics/organisations/muslim-brotherhood.html">Muslim Brotherhood</a> successor, Mohamed Morsi, served for only a year before the military toppled and detained him in 2013, before launching a deadly crackdown on those who backed him.</p>
<p class="ReadMoreContentSeparator"><a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/programmes/rewind/2017/01/seeds-change-revisiting-egypt-april-6-activists-170124035054372.html" target="_self"> WATCH: Seeds of Change: Revisiting Egypt&#x2019;s April 6 activists </a></p>
<p>Hundreds of Morsi&#x2019;s supporters were sentenced to death after speedy trials. Morsi himself has also stood trial in several cases.</p>
<p>Critics say that the abuses they fought under Mubarak have returned with President <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/topics/people/abdel-fattah-el-sisi.html">Abdel Fattah el-Sisi</a>, the former army chief who toppled Morsi.</p>
<p>Mai Mogib, a politics professor at Cairo University, said times have changed since the <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/topics/regions/middleeast.html">Middle East</a> uprisings six years ago.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Talk of the Arab Spring has completely stopped,&#x201D; she said. But &#x201C;discussing Mubarak and symbols of his era has become acceptable in the media and in the street.</p>
<p>&#x201C;He&#x2019;s in a better position than all other presidents who faced the Arab Spring,&#x201D; Mogib said.</p>
<h2><strong>Sisi&#x2019;s pardon</strong></h2>
<p>Also on Monday, Sisi issued a pardon for 203 youths jailed for taking part in demonstrations against his rule, according to state news agency MENA. No official list of names was immediately available.</p>
<p>Since seizing power, Sisi has presided over a crackdown on his opponents that has seen hundreds killed and many thousands jailed.</p>
<p>Al Jazeera journalist Mahmoud Hussein has been <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/topics/issues/journalism-not-crime.html">detained in Egypt</a>&#xA0;without charge for more than 80 days.</p>
<p>Hussein, an Egyptian based in <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/qatar.html">Qatar</a>, was stopped, questioned, and detained by the Egyptian authorities on <a href="https://youtu.be/bVC7iTWdHpI" target="_blank">December 20 after travelling to Cairo for a holiday.</a></p>
