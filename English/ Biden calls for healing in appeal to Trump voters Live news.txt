<h2>Joe Biden &#x2018;no saviour&#x2019; of the Palestinians</h2>
<p>In October 1973, newly elected Delaware Senator Joe Biden visited Israel on his first official overseas trip and met Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meir.</p>
<p>The 30-year-old was visibly moved as Meir explained what she said was Israel&#x2019;s militarily dangerous situation surrounded by &#x201C;enemy states&#x201D;, but he cheered up when the Israeli leader revealed what she said was Israel&#x2019;s secret weapon: The Israelis have nowhere else to go.</p>

<h2>US is our closest and most important ally, says PM Johnson</h2>
<p>The United States is our closest and most important ally, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said, adding London and Washington could do something on trade despite Washington being a tough negotiator.</p>
<p>&#x201C;But on the trade deal with the US, I&#x2019;m a keen student of the United States&#x2019; trade policy and they&#x2019;re tough negotiators,&#x201D; he told reporters.</p>
<p>&#x201C;And I&#x2019;ve never believed that this was going to be something that was going to be a complete pushover under any US administration. I think there&#x2019;s a good chance we&#x2019;ll do something.&#x201D;</p>

<h2>How will a Biden presidency impact NATO and Brexit?</h2>
<p>With Biden defeating Trump in the race for the US presidency, many leaders in Europe are hopeful that a shift in American foreign policy awaits.</p>
<p>Biden has pledged to immediately rejoin a number of initiatives that Trump dumped, including the Paris Agreement on climate change and the Iran nuclear deal, if Tehran also complies. He also vowed to reverse the US&#x2019;s withdrawal from the World Health Organization.</p>

<h2>How will a Biden presidency affect Turkey?</h2>
<p>Just a couple of weeks before president-elect Joe Biden&#x2019;s victory, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan was giving a party rally of his own in southeast Turkey, delivering a defiant message to the United States.</p>
<p>&#x201C;You don&#x2019;t know who you&#x2019;re dealing with,&#x201D; said Erdogan to his NATO ally.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Impose your sanctions already, whatever they may be,&#x201D; he added, referring to US threats over Turkey&#x2019;s purchase of a controversial Russian missile system.</p>
<p>The comments were perhaps also directed at Biden. As one senior Turkish government official told Al Jazeera on condition of anonymity: &#x201C;People here are not overwhelmed with the prospect [of a Biden presidency]&#x201D;.</p>

<p>Iran&#x2019;s president said the next US administration should use the opportunity to compensate for Trump&#x2019;s mistakes, Iranian state TV reported.</p>
<p>Tensions have spiked between the US and Iran since 2018, when Trump exited a nuclear deal between Tehran and world powers, and then reimposed sanctions that have crippled Iran&#x2019;s economy.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Trump&#x2019;s damaging policy has been opposed &#x2026; by the American people. The next US administration should use the opportunity to make up for past mistakes,&#x201D; President Hassan Rouhani was quoted as saying.</p>

<p>Outside the Maricopa County Elections Department, hundreds of supporters of President Donald Trump rallied for a fourth consecutive day, insisting the Democratic Party had stolen the election.</p>
<p>The demonstrators took turns addressing the crowd and kneeling to pray for Trump. At times, they broke out in chants of &#x201C;four more years&#x201D; and &#x201C;back the blue&#x201D;.</p>
<p>Several protesters wore hats reading &#x201C;Make America great again&#x201D;, while others had flags or T-shirts that referenced QAnon &#x2013; the widespread conspiracy theory that Trump is waging a secret war on child sex traffickers.</p>

<h2>Trump campaign files fresh lawsuit in Arizona</h2>
<p>The Trump campaign and Republican National Committee filed a lawsuit Saturday in Arizona that seeks the manual inspection of potentially thousands of in-person Election Day ballots in metro Phoenix that they allege were mishandled by poll workers and resulted in some ballot selections being disregarded.</p>
<p>The legal challenge against Democratic Secretary of State Katie Hobbs looks at instances where people are believed to have voted for more candidates than permitted.</p>
<p>When tabulators detect such an &#x201C;overvote,&#x201D; poll workers should give voters a choice to fix the problem. But the workers instead either asked or told voters to press a button on the machine to override the error, leaving the devices to disregard the problematic ballot selections, according to the lawsuit.</p>
<p>The lawsuit was filed hours after the dismissal of another Arizona election lawsuit that contested the use of Sharpie markers in completing Election Day ballots in Maricopa County. Even though election officials have said voting with a Sharpie would not invalidate a ballot, many social media users in the controversy known as #Sharpiegate have falsely claimed their ballots had been invalidated because they were told to use the markers.</p>
<p>Hobbs&#x2019; spokeswoman Sophia Solis said the secretary of state&#x2019;s office is still reviewing the lawsuit but added that the latest lawsuit &#x201C;is seemingly a repackaged &#x2018;Sharpiegate&#x2019; lawsuit&#x201D;.</p>

<h2>Harris&#x2019; ancestral village in India welcomes win</h2>
<p>After rooting for Kamala Harris as US president-elect Joe Biden&#x2019;s running mate, people in her small ancestral Indian village woke up on Sunday morning to the news of her making history.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Congratulations Kamala Harris, pride of our village, Vanakkam (Greetings) America,&#x201D; the women of Thulasendrapuram wrote in color powder outside her former residence.</p>
<p>Thulasendrapuram, located 350 kilometres (215 miles) from the southern coastal city of Chennai, planned to celebrate Harris&#x2019; success with singing, dancing and firecrackers at a temple later Sunday.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Since November 3 we were waiting for her to win and we are very happy,&#x201D; said Aulmozhi Sudhakar, a village councillor.</p>

<h2>Speech ends with fireworks, drone display</h2>
<p>Biden&#x2019;s first address after news organisations projected him the winner of the presidential election has ended.</p>
<p>Biden gave a message of unity, and promised to lead for all Americans, regardless of who they voted for. He said the coronavirus would be his first priority and hailed his historic vice-president-elect Kamala Harris.</p>
<p>The evening ended with fireworks and drone display that spelt out Biden and 46 in the sky, as the song You make my dreams come true by Hall and Oates and The best by Tina Turner played.</p>

<p>Biden recited words from Psalm 91, a verse in the Bible, that he said had special meaning for his deceased son Beau that &#x201C;captures the faith that sustains me&#x201D;.</p>
<p>He offered in the &#x201C;hope that it can provide some comfort, solace to 230,000 Americans that lost a loved one to this terrible virus this year.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;And he will raise you up on eagles&#x2019; wings, bear you on the breath of dawn, and make you shine like the sun and hold you in the palm of his hand,&#x201D; Biden said reciting the verse &#x201C;And now together, on eagles&#x2019; wings, we embark on the work that God and history have called upon us to do.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Closing the speech, he said: &#x201C;With full hearts and steady hands with faith in America and each other, with love of country a thirst of justice, let us be a nation that we know we can be. A nation united. A nation strengthened. A nation healed.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Supporters of Trump continued protests for a third day outside an election centre in Arizona&#x2019;s capital, while the state&#x2019;s Maricopa County said there were around 90,000 ballots left to count.</p>
<p>Demonstrators claim that what they see as slow ballot counting is part of an effort to steal the election from Trump.</p>
<p>Trump himself has made similar claims on Twitter and during press briefings, saying without evidence that supposedly illegal votes had been cast and that the Democrats had rigged the election.</p>
<p>Some elections department employees had to be escorted out by security guards as the demonstrators rallied.</p>

<p>Benjamin Blei joined the celebration with his wife and son. He also attended Black Lives Matter protests in Philadelphia for Walter Wallace Jr, George Floyd, Breonna Taylor and other African-American victims of police violence. He supported Elizabeth Warren in the Democratic primaries but voted for Biden in the general elections.</p>
<p>Blei said, however, that he plans to be critical of the Biden and Harris administration. &#x201C;We&#x2019;re on a mission to change this country, and that&#x2019;s the important thing, but you have to start with removing Trump and the people who are running his cabinet,&#x201D; he said.</p>

<p>Graham said the Trump campaign had received information from a postal worker in Erie, Pennsylvania who says that supervisors hatched a plan to postmark ballots mailed after the election and make them look as if they had arrived beforehand.</p>
<p>&#x201C;It&#x2019;s imperative that all credible allegations of voting irregularities and misconduct be investigated to ensure the integrity of the 2020 election,&#x201D; Graham said.</p>
<p>&#x201C;I will be calling on the Department of Justice to investigate these claims. I&#x2019;ll also be in contact with the Postmaster General, requesting he look into these allegations &#x2026;&#x201D; Graham said.</p>
<p>Pennsylvania law required ballots to be mailed by Election Day but allows them to be collected and counted for three days afterwards, which the Trump campaign is objecting to in federal and state courts.</p>

<h2>US capital celebrates Biden victory</h2>
<p><em><strong>Al Jazeera&#x2019;s Jihan Abdalla sent this dispatch from Washington, DC</strong></em></p>
<p>Thousands honked their cars, banged on pots and cheered in Washington, DC to celebrate the announcement that Joe Biden won the election over Trump.</p>
<p>Music blared and a festive atmosphere set in at Black Lives Matter Plaza as Biden supporters gathered &#x2013; most wearing face masks to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. They danced and some drank champagne, straight from the bottle.</p>
<p>&#x201C;I could dance and scream all day long,&#x201D; Bernadette Etienne, a retired translator, told Al Jazeera. &#x201C;There is so much misery to expel, so much hatred to get rid of &#x2026; It&#x2019;s been four horrible nightmarish years.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Streets were closed to traffic as large waves of people kept arriving to the sound of honking car horns and cowbells. Some waved American and LGBTQ flags. Many wore Black Lives Matter T-shirts.</p>
<p>&#x201C;I was getting ready for this day for a long time,&#x201D; Andrew Hasson told Al Jazeera. &#x201C;This week was super stressful just waiting for the results to come in, but this is a great feeling and DC feels alive again.&#x201D;</p>

<h2>Al Jazeera&#x2019;s diplomatic correspondent: Reaction from allies &#x2018;pretty clear&#x2019;</h2>
<p>James Bays, Al Jazeera&#x2019;s diplomatic correspondent, has said that with regards to the US&#x2019;s traditional allies, &#x201C;It&#x2019;s pretty clear what the reaction is&#x201D; to Biden&#x2019;s projected win.</p>
<p>&#x201C;They are not saying this publicly, but there is a massive sigh of relief now, and a feeling that perhaps things might return to how they were four years ago in terms of the transatlantic alliance,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;Trump has described the European Union as a foe, whereas Biden has described it as an indispensable partner.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Bays added that a senior EU official had described the past four years during Trump&#x2019;s leadership &#x201C;as the worst period in relations between Europe and the US since the world war.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Bays said that on the other hand, some allies in the Middle East &#x201C;will be calibrating their responses&#x201D;, adding that &#x201C;[Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin] Netanyahu, for example, could not have wished for a better US president for his interests than Trump&#x201D;.</p>

<h2>Macron hopeful over projected Biden victory</h2>
<p>Speaking from Paris, Al Jazeera&#x2019;s Natacha Butler said French President Emmanuel Macron is hopeful the &#x201C;America first&#x201D; approach to foreign policy will soon end.</p>
<p>&#x201C;French President Emmanuel Macron has tweeted his congratulations to Biden and Harris saying that he looks forward to working with them on some of today&#x2019;s challenges,&#x201D; Butler said. &#x201C;There is no doubt that Macron is more closely politically aligned to Biden than he was to Trump.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;What Macron will be hoping for now is that the US returns to a more multilateral approach when it comes to foreign policy after four years of Trump&#x2019;s America-first policy: A return to the Paris climate deal, something that Trump pulled the US out of, and the JCPOA, the Iran nuclear deal, which Trump also pulled the US out of, much to the disappointment of Macron,&#x201D; Butler said.</p>

<h2>Former Ohio secretary of state: Celebrations premature</h2>
<p>In an interview with Al Jazeera, former Ohio Secretary of State Ken Blackwell told Al Jazeera that celebrations were premature.</p>
<p>&#x201C;What we have now are several states where the results are heading towards a spread that is so narrow that any hint of irregularities can in fact be prosecuted,&#x201D; Blackwell, a Republican, said from Philadelphia, referencing Trump&#x2019;s promise to challenge results in states across the country.</p>
<p>&#x201C;There are close races that are still being contested. It is a bit rich that some folks, who never accepted Trump&#x2019;s clear victory, are now celebrating off projections,&#x201D; he said.</p>

<p>The president-elect plans to name a 12-member task force to combat and contain the spread of the coronavirus, news website Axios has reported.</p>
<p>The task force will be led by three co-chairs: former Surgeon General Vivek Murthy, former Food and Drug Administration Commissioner David Kessler and Dr Marcella Nunez-Smith from Yale University, according to Axios.</p>
<p>The plan, which comes before Biden has appointed his cabinet or White House staff, is an apparent attempt to signal that the pandemic will be his top priority.</p>

<h2>Analyst: Harris VP win is an &#x2018;incredible glass ceiling moment for all women everywhere&#x2019;</h2>
<p>Claire Finkelstein, from the University of Pennsylvania Law School, told Al Jazeera that Kamala Harris&#x2019;s win is an &#x201C;incredible glass ceiling moment for all women everywhere&#x201D;.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Especially as a lawyer to watch future VP Harris getting ready to step to a role that no woman in this country has ever held, especially as a woman of colour, is especially exciting and inspiring to all of us,&#x201D; she said.</p>
<p>She added that Trump&#x2019;s promise to challenge the state results in court &#x201C;is in a way a sign of health in our democracy&#x201D;.</p>
<p>&#x201C;If Donald Trump is willing to accept the deliverances of our court system, then in effect, he is willing to play by the rules. As angry as he is and unwilling to accept the results as he has been, if the court rules and he is willing to accept it, then we are still roughly within the domain of the rule of law,&#x201D; she said.</p>

<h2>Muslim organisations hail Biden&#x2019;s vow to end &#x2018;Muslim ban&#x2019;</h2>
<p>The Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) and the No Muslim Ban Ever grassroots coalition have congratulated Biden, while urging him to follow through on his pledge to end the so-called Muslim ban.</p>
<p>&#x201C;President-elect Biden has pledged to end the Muslim ban on his first day in office, include Muslims at every level of his administration and address issues of racial and religious discrimination,&#x201D; said CAIR Executive Director Nihad Awad.</p>
<p>&#x201C;We plan to join other American Muslim leaders and organisations in ensuring that the Biden administration fulfils these promises. We also plan to continue holding our government accountable when it errs,&#x201D; he said.</p>
<p>In 2018, the Supreme Court upheld a Trump policy that banned travellers from several Muslim-majority countries, saying it was allowed if done for national security. Trump&#x2019;s initial 2017 order separated families and left travellers stranded around the world, and has been derided as Islamophobic.</p>

<h2>Celebration breaks out in Biden&#x2019;s home town</h2>
<p>Speaking from Wilmington, Delaware, where Biden is set to address the nation at 8pm ET (01:00 GMT) on Saturday, Al Jazeera&#x2019;s Jamal Elshayyal said the scene was joyful and celebratory.</p>
<p>&#x201C;People have begun to celebrate. It is still a small crowd, but it occasionally lets its voice be heard with celebrations &#x2026; and cheers whenever more people join in,&#x201D; he said.</p>
<p>&#x201C;As much as this is a victory for Joe Biden and a defeat for Donald Trump, it is also a victory for Kamala Harris, a victory for the diversity and opportunity that the US has always prided itself in,&#x201D; he added. &#x201C;That being said, there are huge challenges that exist, there is discrimination that is endemic and institutionalised, as Biden himself has described it.&#x201D;</p>

<h2>Analysis: How Trump will react remains to be seen</h2>
<p><em><strong>Steve Clemons, host of Al Jazeera&#x2019;s The Bottom Line</strong></em></p>
<p>Speaking from Washington, DC, Steve Clemons, host of Al Jazeera English&#x2019;s weekly discussion programme The Bottom Line, said it was yet to be seen how Trump will react to Biden&#x2019;s win, but the circle of support around him will begin to shrink.</p>
<p>&#x201C;The best way to look at what those people around him are saying, is if you go to Laura Ingraham, one of the top Fox News anchors, who regularly speaks to and overtly supports President Trump, she&#x2019;s saying out loud, leave with dignity, take this moment, reflect on democracy. Don&#x2019;t drag this out,&#x201D; he said.</p>
<p>&#x201C;He&#x2019;s an impossible guy to predict. We will have to go through the motions of the next few days [to see what he will do],&#x201D; Clemons said. &#x201C;But the terrain that he controls is going to get smaller and smaller and smaller. You can already see it in the tweets from leading senators who never allowed any distance between themselves and Donald Trump before, but now they are clearly doing that.&#x201D;</p>

<h2>Trump says Biden &#x2018;rushing to falsely pose as the winner&#x2019;</h2>
<p>Trump has said Biden is &#x201C;rushing to falsely pose as the winner&#x201D; of the US election, moments after the Associated Press projected Biden had the electoral votes needed for victory.</p>
<p>&#x201C;The simple fact is this election is far from over. Joe Biden has not been certified as the winner of any states, let alone any of the highly contested states headed for mandatory recounts, or states where our campaign has valid and legitimate legal challenges that could determine the ultimate victor,&#x201D; Trump said in a statement.</p>
<p>In US elections, it is common practice for news organisations, after determining that a candidate no longer has a path to victory, to project a winner in the race. The Trump campaign has said it will challenge the results in several states. Biden flipped battlegrounds Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin and Arizona &#x2013; all states Trump won in 2016, according to the Associated Press.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Beginning Monday, our campaign will start prosecuting our case in court to ensure election laws are fully upheld and the rightful winner is seated,&#x201D; Trump wrote. &#x201C;The American People are entitled to an honest election: that means counting all legal ballots, and not counting any illegal ballots.&#x201D;</p>

<h2>Biden&#x2019;s lead in Pennsylvania grows as vote count continues</h2>
<p><em><strong>Al Jazeera&#x2019;s Hilary Beaumont sent in this report from Philadelphia</strong></em></p>
<p>Saturday morning, Biden&#x2019;s lead over Trump grew to 28,877 votes in Pennsylvania, where counting continued in most counties.</p>
<p>The Associated Press news agency has not called the race because of the close margin and large number of outstanding votes. The votes left to count were mostly provisional ballots.</p>
<p>The count stretched on in Allegheny County, where Biden was up by 20 points Friday morning. County executives said they had about 20,000 to 23,000 mail ballots left to count.</p>
<p>Biden&#x2019;s lead in the state comes from marginal increases over 2016 Democratic Party candidate Hillary Clinton in the suburbs and Trump country.</p>
<p>Clinton won Allegheny County, which includes the city of Pittsburgh, by 16.4 points four years ago.</p>

<p>Trump &#x2013; who falsely claimed victory in the presidential race in an address on Wednesday, and on Friday urged Biden not to &#x201C;wrongfully claim victory&#x201D; &#x2013; has again falsely claimed that he won the presidential election.</p>
<p>No winner has been projected by the Associated Press or other election-tracking organisations, but Biden maintains a widening lead in several key battleground states. Twitter quickly flagged Trump&#x2019;s tweet with an alert that &#x201C;official sources may not have called the race when this was Tweeted&#x201D;.</p>
<p>Trump had previously falsely claimed victory in the key battlegrounds of Pennsylvania, North Carolina and Georgia, long before a victor had emerged in those states. Biden currently holds a lead in Pennsylvania and Georgia.</p>
