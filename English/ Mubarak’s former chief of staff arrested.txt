<p>Egyptian state prosecutors have ordered that a former top aide to Hosni Mubarak, the country&#x2019;s&#xA0;ousted president,&#xA0;be jailed for 15 days pending a corruption investigation.</p>
<p>Zakaria Azmi, Mubarak&#x2019;s chief of staff for 22 years, was arrested on Thursday after being&#xA0;accused of using his position to amass a personal fortune.</p>
<p>Prosecutor Assem el-Gawhari announced Azmi&#x2019;s preliminary&#xA0;imprisonment on state television.</p>
<p>Azmi was considered an influential figure within Mubarak&#x2019;s&#xA0;ruling National Democratic Party (NDP)&#xA0;and is one of many former regime officials whom protesters would like to see prosecuted or at least investigated.</p>
<p>The slow pace of those investigations, and&#xA0;a lack of arrests, have spurred the protest movement to rally followers back into the streets,&#xA0;with large demonstrations&#xA0;planned for Cairo&#x2019;s Tahrir Square on Friday. </p>
<p>Protesters are also demanding the complete dissolution of the NDP.</p>
<p>Azmi, an NDP politician from east Cairo, served as Mubarak&#x2019;s chief of staff from 1989 until the president stepped down on February 11,&#xA0;following 18 days of upheaval that saw millions of Egyptians take to the streets.</p>
<p>Following&#xA0;Mubarak&#x2019;s&#xA0;resignation, state prosecutors arrested three high-ranking officials:&#xA0;interior minister Habib el-Adly, housing minister Ahmed Maghrabi, and tourism minister Zuheir Garana.</p>
<p>Protesters&#xA0;have continued to demand investigations into other powerful figures, including Safwat el-Sherif, speaker of the upper house of parliament, and Fathi Sorour, speaker of the lower house.</p>
