<p>An Egyptian court has&#xA0;ordered the release of former President Hosni Mubarak over the deaths of protesters but he will remain in custody over fraud charges, according to court officials.</p>
<p>A judge on Monday ordered Mubarak&#x2019;s release on bail for charges over his complicity in the&#xA0;killing of protesters but this decision did not cancel his detention due to ongoing separate charges, the officials said.</p>
<p>&#x201C;He has been freed only in one case,&#x201D; Al Jazeera&#x2019;s Anita McNaught reported from Cairo.</p>
<p>&#x201C;However, there are many corruption cases still lined up for [Mubarak]&#x201D;.</p>
<p>Mubarak, 84, has spent the maximum legal time of two years in detention since being charged with Habib al-Adli, former interior minister,&#xA0;for their involvement in the killing of protesters in the 2011 uprising that unseated him.</p>
<p>Mubarak&#x2019;s case is facing an indefinite delay after a retrial was aborted on Saturday when the presiding judge withdrew from the case.</p>
<p>Mubarak and Adli were sentenced to life terms at their first trial in June but the highest appeal court ordered a retrial after accepting appeals from the defence and prosecution.</p>
<p>Mubarak, who ruled Egypt for almost 30 years before being toppled by 18 days of unrest, is also facing an investigation over financial corruption charges, Egyptian media has reported.</p>
<p>He has been staying in a military hospital from where he was flown by helicopter to the court on Saturday.</p>
<p>The prosecutor general&#x2019;s office on Saturday ordered an urgent medical report on him to determine whether he was now fit enough to be sent to prison where he had stayed before.</p>
