<p>&#x201C;No, Islam was not spread by the sword,&#x201D; he said, gently touching the microphone. &#x201C;One of the fundamental tenets of Islam is that there is no compulsion in religion &#x2013; you have your religion and I have mine.&#x201D; </p>

Hundreds of protesters rushed outside with placards proclaiming that the Vatican&#x2018;s war on Islam is an extension of Bush&#x2019;s war on Islam.

<p>Many Islamists, blocked by dozens of security personnel from spilling out on to the streets, went round-and-round the gate carrying a young man and chanting after him: &#x201C;Oh [Egyptian president Hosni] Mubarak, where are you? Where are you? Muhammad&#x2019;s religion is your religion too.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Many of those in the mosque and courtyard &#x2013; belonging to Islamist groups, the Muslim Brotherhood or merely as independents &#x2013; were as angry, if not more, at their own Arab rulers. They said that Arab governments are pliant and submissive and do not defend the faith and nation. Iraq, Palestine, and Lebanon were cited as examples of collusion between Arab rulers and their Western masters.</p>
<p>A young curly haired teenager named Hussein, who claimed no political affiliation, said he was protesting &#x201C;because our Prophet is being smeared, and none of our leaders are defending him&#x201D;.</p>

<p>Kamal told me that Muslims do not view the pontiff&#x2019;s statement in isolation. Coming on the heels of president Bush&#x2019;s declaration of a &#x201C;war of civilisation&#x201D; on &#x201C;Islamic fascists,&#x201D; the pope&#x2019;s comments supply religious justification for the Western onslaught against Islam and Muslims.</p>
