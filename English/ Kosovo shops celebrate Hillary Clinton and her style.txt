<p><strong><span>Pristina, Kosovo &#x2013;</span></strong> Tucked away inside&#xA0;<span>Kosovo&#x2019;s largest Communist-era housing and shopping complex, one store stands out.</span></p>
<p>Behind mannequins in trouser suits and shiny gowns sits a framed photograph of Hillary Clinton with a beaming young woman. The store is called Hillary 2.</p>

<p><span>In 2002, when the Morinas opened their first store, Feim, 69, decided it would be fitting to call it Hillary.</span></p>
<p><span>He had always admired Clinton&#x2019;s taste in fashion as First Lady and&#xA0;</span>&#x201C;wanted to also thank her and America in a way for everything that they have done for us&#x201D;.</p>
<p><span>The first boutique opened for business a few years after the brutal war in Kosovo ended in June 1999 when 78 days of NATO air strikes drove out&#xA0;Slobodan Milosevic&#x2019;s&#xA0;security&#xA0;forces from the tiny province that was then part of Serbia and mostly inhabited by ethnic Albanians.&#xA0;</span></p>
<p><span>US President Bill Clinton launched the strikes to prevent another genocide from unfolding in the Balkans, as had happened in Bosnia a few years earlier.</span></p>
<p><span>The Hillary boutique,</span>&#xA0;located on Bill Clinton Boulevard, has changed premises since it first opened but remains on the same street.</p>
<p>Fourteen years after the Morinas started their family business, Hillary remains the &#x201C;go-to&#x201D; place for women, mostly working professionals in their mid-20s to 40s, seeking the latest styles from Istanbul.</p>
<p><span>&#x201C;We have customers who come from all over Kosovo; they like the name and the styles,&#x201D; said Besian Morina, who runs Hillary while his sister manages Hillary 2.</span></p>

<p><span>Regular Hillary customer Merita, who did not want to give her surname, a blonde, curly-haired woman with oversized black sunglasses, described&#xA0;</span>Clinton&#x2019;s style as &#x201C;elegant&#x201D;, citing it as one of the reasons why she visits the shop at least three times a week.</p>
<p><span>&#x201C;I believe that it&#x2019;s an inspiration to all women,&#x201D; she said of Clinton&#x2019;s style.</span></p>
<p><span>As it is in the US, 2016 is a presidential election year in Kosovo. </span></p>
<p>In 2011 the young country elected its<a class="internallink" href="http://www.aljazeera.com/programmes/women-make-change/2015/10/road-kosovo-female-president-151021070704139.html" target="_blank"> first female president, Atifete Jahjaga,</a> whose term ends in April.</p>
<p><span>Morina and his family are closely watching the US elections, and&#xA0;it remains clear that&#xA0;they, like many&#xA0;Kosovars, would like to see the Clinton legacy live on.</span></p>
<p><span>&#x201C;We have a big sympathy for that family. We think she is a woman with a big vision for [America&#x2019;s] future. We think she deserves to win,&#x201D; Elda said.</span></p>
<p><span>She greeted Hillary Clinton in 2010 when the secretary of state paid a surprise visit to the &#x201C;Hillary&#x201D; store, as captured in the framed photograph which sits in both stores.</span></p>

<figure id="attachment_843421" style="width:770px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="size-large wp-image-843421" src="/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/b28f36d77dd04c76a4fe369509075f4f_18.jpeg">A group of young women walk past the &#x2018;Hillary 2&#x2019; store, in a shopping mall built during the former Yugoslavia in the early 1970s [Valerie Plesch/Al Jazeera]</figure>

<p><span>Kosovo&#x2019;s unilateral independence is still not recognised by all of the international community, including key UN member states such as Russia and China and five European Union countries.</span></p>
<p><span>Elda says Clinton&#x2019;s unwavering support for Kosovo has helped put the country on the international map.</span></p>
<p><span>Hillary and Hillary 2 are now among the tourist attractions in the capital of Europe&#x2019;s youngest nation, particularly Hillary as it&#x2019;s only a few steps away from a 3.5m statue of a waving Bill Clinton, another landmark in the city, unveiled in 2009.&#xA0;</span></p>
<p><span>Curious visitors from around the world, from China, Russia, Albania, the US &#x2013; including American soldiers stationed here as part of the ongoing NATO peacekeeping operation &#x2013; and even Serbia, often stop by the boutique on a nondescript street, nestled between an optics store and a closed-down pinball cafe, to take a peek inside or pose for a photo in front of the store.</span></p>
<p><span>Post-war Kosovo saw a rise in shopping malls and women&#x2019;s stores selling clothes imported from&#xA0;China and&#xA0;Turkey at discounted prices.</span></p>
<p><span>But none seemed to match the more upmarket styles sold at Hillary &#x2013; particularly the famous trouser and skirt suits &#x2013; which Elda Morina considers to be the style&#xA0;that most exemplifies Clinton and which has made the store famous for fashion-conscious women seeking professional clothing.</span></p>
<p><span>Inside the </span>boutique,&#xA0;an&#xA0;array of tomato red, dark navy and cobalt blue trouser and skirt suits hang on racks, reminiscent of the 1990s when Clinton was the First Lady.<strong>&#xA0;</strong></p>
<p><span>&#x201C;We&#x2019;ve always had a section dedicated to Hillary,&#x201D; said Besian Morina, referring to the trouser and skirt suits, which cost between 80 and 100 euros ($87-$108).</span></p>

<p><span>Apart from the suit ensembles,&#xA0;</span>Morina also sells plush winter coats, floor-length sequined dresses and halter-necked evening gowns in a separate room inside the store.</p>
<p><span>Morina and his sister travel monthly to Istanbul to place clothing orders.</span></p>
<p><span>Selvije Haliti, 51, a nurse from Pristina with a neatly coiffed bob and a brightly coloured scarf, has been visiting the boutique since it opened in 2002.</span></p>
<p><span>She has been following the US election campaign and hopes that Clinton will become the Democratic presidential candidate.</span></p>
<p><span>&#x201C;We are proud that we know the name of Hillary Clinton as a nation, and for as long as live we will always be thankful to her and her life,&#x201D; said Haliti, during a visit to check out a red skirt suit.</span></p>
<p><span>But even for those who may never set foot inside the store, Clinton remains a popular candidate for the next US president.</span></p>
<p><span>&#x201C;I know that the wife of Bill Clinton was for Kosovo, they saved us and we will never forget that,&#x201D; said Dula Jashari, 76, a former policeman.</span></p>
<p><span>&#x201C;If it hadn&#x2019;t been for America, there wouldn&#x2019;t have been a single Albanian in Kosovo.&#x201D;</span></p>
<p><span>Back at Hillary, Besian Morina says he wants to expand the family business.&#xA0;</span></p>
<p><span>&#x201C;My dream is to have my own [clothing] brand, which is the Hillary brand.&#x201D;</span></p>
