<p>A tweet quoting <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/topics/people/nelson-mandela.html">Nelson Mandela</a> by former US President <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/topics/people/barack-obama.html">Barack Obama</a> has picked up more than 3 million likes on Twitter, breaking the record for most likes.</p>
<p>Posted on Sunday, the tweet reached the milestone on Thursday, breaking the previous record held by singer Ariana Grande after a bombing at one of her concerts in the English city of Manchester.</p>
<p>&#x201C;No one is born hating another person because of the color of his skin or his background or his religion&#x2026;&#x201D; Obama wrote, quoting the late South African president.</p>

<p>The tweet, Obama&#x2019;s first in weeks, came in the context of deadly white supremacist violence in the town of Charlottesville, Virginia.</p>
<p>Heather Heyer, 32, was killed when a man drove a car into a crowd of anti-hate protesters on Saturday.</p>
<p>Police later arrested white supremacist James Fields Jr and charged him with second-degree murder, as well as other charges.</p>
<p>Obama has authored six of the top 10 most liked tweets in history.</p>
<p>His successor, US President <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/topics/people/donald-trump.html">Donald Trump</a>, is a more prolific Twitter user but has yet to reach the Democrat&#x2019;s popularity on social media.</p>
<p>Trump&#x2019;s reaction to the violence in Charlottesville stood in stark contrast to Obama.</p>
<p>The 45th president of the US has repeatedly blamed both sides for the violence but also said there were &#x201C;very fine&#x201D; people on each side.</p>
