<p>The verdict in the trial of Hosni Mubarak, the&#xA0;deposed Egyptian president, will be delivered on June 2, according to the judge presiding over the case.</p>
<p>News agencies quoted Judge Ahmed Refaat as saying during Wednesday&#x2019;s hearing: &#x201C;We have vowed to speak the truth. We are committed to this vow.</p>
<p>&#x201C;It is a commitment that justice and truth will be our constitution.&#x201D;</p>
<p>The prosecution has called for the death penalty for Mubarak, who&#xA0;turned down a chance to address the court&#xA0;in&#xA0;the&#xA0;final session.</p>
<p>If convicted Mubarak, his interior minister Habib al-Adly and six security chiefs could receive the death penalty for ordering the deaths of protesters during the uprising that toppled Mubarak a year ago.</p>
<p>Adly addressed the court for more than an hour and a half, speaking of a &#x201C;conspiracy&#x201D; against Egypt, state television said.</p>
<p>He defended himself and the police against the charge of murder, drawing applause from some police officers standing at the back of the courtroom.</p>
<p>Adly said &#x201C;foreigners&#x201D; had killed the protesters, and that they had climbed on the rooftops of buildings and shot them. He&#xA0;blamed Hezbollah, a Lebanese political group, and Hamas, a Palestinian political group, for sending infiltrators, and said the plot against Egypt was continuing to this day.</p>
<p><strong>Corruption charges</strong></p>
<p>Mubarak shares the defendants&#x2019; cage with his two sons, Alaa and Gamal, who face corruption charges along with their father.</p>
<p>State television reported that prosecutors told Refaat&#xA0;that the medical wing of Cairo&#x2019;s Tora prison was ready to receive Mubarak, following mounting calls to move him from hospital to prison.</p>
<p>The trial was supposed to be a historic moment when Mubarak is brought to justice by his people, but it has been widely criticised as little more than political theatre.</p>
<p>The case is legally weak, lawyers say, charging that the prosecution has taken to the microphone to deliver sermons rather than hard evidence.</p>
<p>The trial itself, which began in August, has been plagued by interuptions in the form of a short investigation period, brief hearings, a three-month hiatus, incomplete testimonies and a speedy ending, the lawyers said.</p>
<p>Activists say they would have rather seen Mubarak tried for abuses and mismanagement committed during his 30 years in power than for events that took place during a few days of the uprising.</p>
<p>Egypt&#x2019;s&#xA0;governing Supreme Council of the Armed Forces has been the target of protesters&#x2019; anger in the past months over accusations of mismanagement and human rights abuses.</p>
<p>More than 850 people were killed and thousands more were injured during the 18 days of mass nationwide protests that ended Mubarak&#x2019;s 30-year rule.</p>
