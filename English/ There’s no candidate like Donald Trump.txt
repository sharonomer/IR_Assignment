<p><span>There has never been a presidential candidate like Donald Trump.</span></p>
<p><span>He inspires and frightens the Republican Party in almost equal measure. While his poll numbers continue to tick upwards, Republican operatives are planning a campaign to try to take him down. </span></p>
<p><span>They&#x2019;re attracting big-money investors for a series of attack ads aimed at derailing a campaign many thought would have hit the buffers long before now.</span></p>
<p><span>But there&#x2019;s a concern that there is nothing they can do to stop him because the rules don&#x2019;t seem to apply to &#x201C;The Donald&#x201D;.</span></p>
<p><span>He&#x2019;s dominated the headlines in recent days because of his anti-Muslim comments. And it&#x2019;s worth taking a few minutes to look at how that&#x2019;s unfolded.</span></p>
<p><span>On Thursday, in an interview published by Yahoo News he suggested that after the attacks in Paris, there would have to be greater surveillance of Muslims in the US.</span></p>
<p>He was then asked if that might require registering Muslims in a database, or crucially, presenting them with some form of identification card which listed their religion, in the words of the article.</p>
<p>He didn&#x2019;t rule that out.</p>
<p>&#x201C;We&#x2019;re going to have to &#x2013; we&#x2019;re going to have to look at a lot of things very closely,&#x201D; Trump said when presented with the idea.</p>
<p>&#x201C;We&#x2019;re going to have to look at the mosques. We&#x2019;re going to have to look very, very carefully.&#x201D;</p>
<p><strong>&#x2018;A lot of systems&#x2019;</strong></p>
<p class="no-indent"><span>Later that same day, an American network TV reporter asked Trump: &#x201C;</span><span>Should there be a database or system that tracks Muslims in this country?&#x201D;</span></p>
<p class="no-indent"><span>Trump replied: &#x201C;There should be a lot of systems, beyond databases. I mean, we should have a lot of systems. And today you can do it. </span></p>
<p class="no-indent"><span>&#x201C;But right now we have to have a border, we have to have strength, we have to have a wall, and we cannot let what&#x2019;s happening in this country happen any longer.&#x201D; </span></p>
<p class="no-indent"><span>The TV reporter pushed on: &#x201C;But that&#x2019;s something your White House would want to implement?&#x201D; </span></p>
<p class="no-indent"><span>To which Trump replied: &#x201C;Oh, I would certainly implement that. Absolutely.&#x201D;</span></p>
<p class="no-indent"><span>The Trump campaign argued that Trump was &#x201C;absolutely committed to a wall, not a database&#x201D;, suggesting that in the tumult of a campaign stop, the candidate misheard the question.&#xA0;</span></p>
<p class="no-indent">But the reporter had followed up again and asked if the plan meant going to mosques to sign people up.</p>
<p class="no-indent">To that Trump replied: &#x201C;Different places. You sign &#x2019;em up at different, but it&#x2019;s all about management. Our country has no management.&#x201D;</p>
<p class="no-indent">From that exchange, it&#x2019;s clear this was not about a wall.</p>
<p class="no-indent">Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders, two of the Democratic front-runners, predictably condemned the comments as did Republican rivals Jeb Bush, John Kasich and Ted Cruz.</p>
<p class="no-indent">But perhaps the most telling criticism came from the American Jewish Committee, which called the idea &#x201C;outrageous and un-American&#x201D;.</p>
<p class="no-indent">Drawing parallels with Nazi Germany and the forced registration of the Jewish people, it said: &#x201C;What Mr Trump proposes, in this case targeting all Muslims, is a horror movie that we Jews are quite familiar with.&#x201D;</p>
<p class="no-indent"><strong>No reverse gear</strong></p>
<p class="no-indent"><span>For Donald Trump, there appears to be no reverse gear. In the past when confronted with some of the outrageous things he said, there has been no apology, no retraction.&#xA0;</span></p>
<p class="no-indent"><span>At campaign stops he blamed the media, claiming the &#x201C;bloodsuckers&#x201D; were dishonest about things he said.&#xA0;</span></p>
<p class="no-indent"><span>When it came to refugees from Syria, he told one crowd of supporters, &#x201C;I want surveillance of<span class="apple-converted-space">&#xA0;</span><em><span>these people</span></em>. I want surveillance if we have to and I don&#x2019;t care. I want &#x2013; are you ready for this, folks? &#x2013; I want surveillance of certain mosques, OK?&#x201D;</span></p>
<p class="no-indent"><span>Asked if he was not ruling out a database of all Muslims , he replied: &#x201C;No, not at all.&#x201D;</span></p>
<p class="no-indent">At a rally on Saturday, Trump added a new line to his anti-Muslim rhetoric, claiming that after the attacks in New York on September 11<span style="font-size:13.3333px">,&#xA0;</span>2001, he watched &#x201C;news footage of thousands and thousands of people&#x201D; celebrating the attack in Jersey City, New Jersey, &#x201C;where&#x201D; in his words &#x201C;you have a large Arab population&#x201D;.</p>

</div>
<p class="no-indent">In a TV interview on Sunday, Trump insisted he had seen the footage and that to suggest he hadn&#x2019;t was simply being &#x201C;politically correct&#x201D;, which, along with attacks on the media, is another Trump trope.</p>
<p class="no-indent"><span>So the fact-checkers went to work. And no one could find any footage or any coverage of protests in the place and the time Trump described.</span></p>
<p class="no-indent"><span>The police said it didn&#x2019;t happen. People in the area said it didn&#x2019;t happen.</span></p>
<p class="no-indent"><span>At the time of the attacks, police rushed to the nearby town of Paterson where they heard there was a large gathering of men in the centre of the city&#x2019;s Middle Eastern Community.&#xA0; &#xA0;</span></p>
<p class="no-indent"><span>&#x201C;When we got there, they were all in prayer,&#x201D; said the town&#x2019;s police chief. </span></p>
<p class="no-indent"><span>The mayor of Jersey City tweeted his response saying Trump &#x201C;has memory issues or willfully distorts the truth&#x201D;.</span></p>
<p class="no-indent"><span>At his next campaign rally, Trump insisted his office had been bombarded with people calling &#x201C;hundreds of people&#x201D;, saying they remember the pictures too.</span></p>
<p><span>The Washington Post checked out Trump&#x2019;s claims and could find anything to support him.</span></p>
<p><strong>Apology demanded</strong></p>
<p><span>Concluding Trump lied, its Fact Checker column wrote: &#x201C;Tr</span><span>ump has defamed the Muslim communities of New Jersey. </span></p>
<p><span>&#x201C;He cannot simply assert something so damning; he must provide some real evidence or else issue an apology.&#x201D;</span></p>
<p><span>But with his crowds growing, his poll numbers rising and the possibility he may actually win the Republican nomination, Trump continues to defy expectations and to defy conventional wisdom.</span></p>
<p><span>The negative publicity seems to fuel the candidate and rile up his base support. It seems no matter what he says; his crowds don&#x2019;t care.&#xA0; </span></p>
<p><span>The suggestion he&#x2019;s making up policy on the hoof doesn&#x2019;t seems to matter.</span></p>
<p><span>He continues to win support.</span></p>
<p><span>That&#x2019;s what continues to worry the Republican Party establishment and why Donald Trump is no ordinary candidate.</span></p>
