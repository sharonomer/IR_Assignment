<p>Hosni Mubarak&#x2019;s&#xA0;defiant speech announcing that he would not resign as president&#xA0;but transfer some powers to his&#xA0;deputy has failed to allay the concerns of the international community and pro-democracy Egyptians.</p>
<p>After meeting with his top national security team, Barack Obama, the US&#xA0;president, warned that the transfer of some powers from Mubarak to vice-president Omar&#xA0;Suleiman did not represent a credible and concrete change.</p>
<p>Obama added that Cairo &#x201C;must spell out a clear path to democracy.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;The Egyptian people have been told that there was a transition of authority, but it is not yet clear that this transition is immediate, meaningful or sufficient,&#x201D;&#xA0;he said in a <a class="InternalLink" href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2011/02/10/statement-president-barack-obama-egypt" target="_blank">statement</a>.</p>
<p>Echoing Obama&#x2019;s position, the&#xA0;European Union&#x2019;s foreign policy chief said Mubarak&#x2019;s remarks did not allay the concerns of the Egyptian people and the international community.</p>
<p>In a statement, Catherine Ashton said &#x201C;the time for change [in Egypt] is now&#x201D;.</p>
<p>&#x201C;President Mubarak has not yet opened the way to faster and deeper reforms,&#x201D; she said, adding that the EU would continue to &#x201C;engage with the Egyptian authorities to convey the need for an orderly, meaningful and lasting democratic transition&#x201D;.</p>
<p><strong>&#x2018;Limited influence&#x2019;</strong></p>
<p>Also speaking after Mubarak&#x2019;s speech, Nicolas Sarkozy, the French president, said the announcement was &#x201C;unavoidable&#x201D;, and that he hoped Egypt would establish a healthy democracy rather than a &#x201C;religious dictatorship&#x201D; when Mubarak eventually&#xA0;leaves office.</p>
<p>William Hague, the British foreign minister said his country was calling for &#x201C;an urgent but orderly transition to a broadly-based government in Egypt&#x201D;.</p>

<p>But he&#xA0;stressed that Britain did not seek to meddle in Egyptian affairs, and that &#x201C;the solution to this has to be owned by the Egyptian people themselves.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Hague said&#xA0;it is not clear what powers Mubarak is handing over to his deputy&#xA0;Suleiman.</p>
<p>Guido Westerwelle, the German foreign minister, said Mubarak&#x2019;s speech &#x201C;was not the hoped for step forward&#x201D;.</p>
<p>However the Danish prime minister has been the only EU leader who has directly and publicly urged Mubarak to stand down since Thursday&#x2019;s speech.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Mubarak is history, Mubarak must step down,&#x201D; Lars Loekke Rasmussen said in Copenhagen, the capital, on Friday.</p>
<p>Barnaby Phillips, Al Jazeera&#x2019;s correspondent in London, said despite their comments, Western leaders &#x201C;know that their ability to influence events is very, very limited&#x201D;.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Ashton&#x2019;s attempts to actually visit Egypt have been consistently rebuffed by the government there, who say that they are simply too busy to cope with her visit.</p>
<p>&#x201C;And we&#x2019;ve seen over the last few weeks how difficult it is for the Americans to really influence events on Egypt,&#x201D; he said.</p>
<p>Ehud Barak, the Israeli defence minister, said&#xA0;it was not for foreign governments to decide what was best for Egypt.</p>
<p>&#x201C;We should not pretend that we are more important for the Egyptian people than their own interests.&#xA0; I don&#x2019;t think I have to respond on this.&#xA0; It&#x2019;s up to the Egyptian people to find a way and do it according to their own constitution, norms and practices,&#x201D; he said in comments delivered at the United Nations headquarters in New York.</p>
<p>Earlier in the day, Binyamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, responded to reports that Mubarak may resign by saying that he hoped whoever replaced him would uphold Egypt&#x2019;s peace treaty with Israel, according to an Israeli radio report.</p>
