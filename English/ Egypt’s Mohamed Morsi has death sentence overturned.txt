<p>The organisation to which he belonged, the Muslim Brotherhood, has since been outlawed. A government crackdown on the movement, as well as other groups, has resulted in tens of thousands of arrests and mass trials.</p>
<p>Morsi was tried in an Egyptian court on several charges, including one of escaping prison during the 2011 uprising against then-president Hosni Mubarak.</p>
<p>He was also accused of sharing state secrets with foreign powers, including Qatar. His defence argued that he was merely engaging all foreign entities within the limits that any head of state would.</p>

<p>Mass trials have sentenced hundreds of Egyptians to death. Rights groups have also called attention to the&#xA0;<a href="https://www.hrw.org/report/2016/09/27/we-are-tombs/abuses-egypts-scorpion-prison" target="_blank">prison abuse</a>&#xA0;in Egypt&#x2019;s detention system.&#xA0;</p>
