<p><span>Hosni Mubarak, the former Egyptian&#xA0;president,&#xA0;has appeared at his&#xA0;<span>retrial </span>on charges of complicity in the killings of protesters during the uprising that toppled him from power&#xA0;two years ago.</span></p>
<p><span>He&#xA0;was&#xA0;</span>escorted by medical and security personnel on Sunday&#xA0;into an ambulance to be taken by helicopter from Maadi Military Hospital to the Cairo Police Academy, where he faced judges again before the trial was adjourned until September 14.</p>
<p>Mubarak&#x2019;s two sons and the former interior minister,&#xA0;Habib al-Adly, also appeared at the trial amid heavy security presence. The sons face charges of corruption while al-Adly is a co-defendant in the complicity case.</p>

<p>The judge ordered the creation of panels of experts to examine all charges. They will be sworn in at the next hearing, and will then have 30 days to investigate.</p>
<p>Al Jazeera&#x2019;s Wayne Hay, reporting from outside the academy, said Mubarak&#x2019;s initial appearance was procedural.</p>
<p>Mubarak, 85, was found guilty and sentenced to life in prison last year for complicity in the killing of about 900 protesters during the 18-day revolt against him in 2011.</p>
<p>He is being retried after his successful appeal against the previous conviction.</p>
<p>&#x201C;The judge assured the public that the trial would be &#x2018;a very transparent process&#x2019; and that people would be given access to the documents used as evidence in the case,&#x201D; our correspondent said.</p>
<p>Mubarak&#xA0;has been under house arrest after being released from detention last week.</p>
<p><strong>Trial adjourned</strong></p>
<p>Separately, the trial of Mohamed Badie, &#x201C;spiritual leader&#x201D; of Egypt&#x2019;s Muslim Brotherhood, and his two deputies,&#xA0;Khairat al-Shater and Rashad Bayoumy, was adjourned<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy7wf4xVmvY" target="_blank"> just minutes</a> after it opened on Sunday.</p>
<p>The court adjourned the trial of the Brotherhood leaders and 32 other defendants&#xA0;till October 29 so that the defendants could be brought to court.</p>
<p>The&#xA0;men, who officials said&#xA0;did not appear in court for security reasons, are accused of inciting the murder of protesters.</p>
<p>Sunday&#x2019;s hearing was the first in the proceedings against the&#xA0;senior Brotherhood leaders, who were detained after the removal of President Mohamed Morsi from power by the military on July 3.</p>
<p>According to security sources, at least 2,000&#xA0;Brotherhood members&#xA0;have been arrested since August 14.</p>
<p>The son of Mohamed El-Beltagi, a Muslim Brotherhood leader and former member of parliament, was arrested on Sunday along&#xA0;with&#xA0;four other former&#xA0;legislators in Beni Suef, in Upper Egypt.</p>
<p>They are accused of inciting violence, disturbing public peace and possessing arms.</p>
<p>On the same day,&#xA0;Dawoud Khairat, a close aide of Mohamed al-Zawahri, brother of al-Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahri, was detained on accusations of inciting violence, committing vandalism acts and belonging to a &#x201C;terrorist group&#x201D;.</p>
<p>The&#xA0;Interior Ministry announced&#xA0;on Saturday&#xA0;the arrest of Mohye Hamed, an adviser to Morsi.</p>
<p>Hazem el-Beblawi, Egypt&#x2019;s interim prime minister, said on Saturday that his government was putting priority on increasing security to restore peace and improve the country&#x2019;s&#xA0;economy.</p>
<p>He also dismissed accusations that Mubarak&#x2019;s release was a return to Egypt&#x2019;s old political order.</p>
