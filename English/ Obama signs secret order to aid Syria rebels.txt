<p>US President Barack Obama has&#xA0;signed a secret order authorising US support for rebels&#xA0;seeking to depose Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and his&#xA0;government, Reuters news agency said quoting&#xA0;sources familiar with the matter.</p>
<p>Obama&#x2019;s order, approved earlier this year and known as an&#xA0;intelligence &#x201C;finding&#x201D;, broadly permits the CIA and other US agencies to provide aid that could help the rebels&#xA0;dislodge&#xA0;Assad from power.</p>
<p>The shift towards supporting Assad&#x2019;s armed opponents intensified following last month&#x2019;s failure of the&#xA0;UN Security Council to agree on tougher sanctions against the&#xA0;Damascus government.</p>
<p>The full extent of clandestine support that agencies like&#xA0;the CIA might be providing also is unclear.&#xA0;White House spokesman Tommy Vietor declined comment on the matter.</p>
<p>The White House&#xA0;has apparently stopped short of giving the rebels lethal weapons, even as some US allies have been doing just that.</p>
<p>US and European officials have said that there have&#xA0;been noticeable improvements in the coherence and effectiveness&#xA0;of Syrian rebel groups in the past few weeks. That represents a&#xA0;significant change in assessments of the rebels by Western&#xA0;officials, who previously characterised Assad&#x2019;s opponents as a&#xA0;disorganised.&#xA0;</p>
<p><strong>Overt support</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>Separately from the president&#x2019;s secret order, the Obama&#xA0;administration has stated publicly that it is providing some&#xA0;backing for Assad&#x2019;s opponents.</p>
<p>The State Department said on Wednesday the US government had set aside a total of $25m for &#x201C;non-lethal&#x201D; assistance to the rebels.</p>
<p>A US official said that was mostly&#xA0;for communications equipment, including encrypted radios.</p>
<p>The State Department also says the US has set&#xA0;aside $64m in humanitarian assistance for the Syrian&#xA0;people, including contributions to the World Food Program, the&#xA0;International Committee of the Red Cross and other aid agencies.</p>
<p><strong>&#x2018;Nerve centre&#x2019;</strong></p>
<p>A US government source acknowledged that under provisions&#xA0;of the presidential finding, the US was collaborating&#xA0;with a secret command centre operated by Turkey and its allies.</p>
<p>Last week, Reuters reported that, along with Saudi Arabia&#xA0;and Qatar, Turkey had established a secret base near the Syrian&#xA0;border to help direct vital military and communications support&#xA0;to Assad&#x2019;s opponents.</p>
<p>This &#x201C;nerve centre&#x201D; is in Adana, a city in southern Turkey&#xA0;about 100km from the Syrian border, which is also&#xA0;home to Incirlik, a US airbase where US military and&#xA0;intelligence agencies maintain a substantial presence.</p>
<p>Turkish authorities&#xA0;are said to be&#xA0;increasingly involved in providing Syrian rebels with training&#xA0;and possibly equipment.</p>
<p>European government sources said wealthy families in Saudi&#xA0;Arabia and Qatar were providing significant financing to the&#xA0;rebels. Senior officials of the Saudi and Qatari governments&#xA0;have publicly called for Assad&#x2019;s departure.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, reports emerged that the Free Syrian Army had&#xA0;obtained nearly two dozen surface-to-air missiles, weapons that could be used against Assad&#x2019;s helicopters and fixed-wing&#xA0;aircraft.</p>
<p>Syrian government armed forces have employed such air&#xA0;power more extensively in recent days.</p>
<p>NBC network said the shoulder-fired missiles, also known as MANPADs,&#xA0;had been delivered to the rebels via Turkey.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, however, Bassam al-Dada, a political adviser&#xA0;to the Free Syrian Army, denied the NBC report, telling the&#xA0;Arabic-language TV network Al-Arabiya that the group had &#x201C;not&#xA0;obtained any such weapons at all&#x201D;.</p>
<p>US government sources said&#xA0;they could not confirm the MANPADs deliveries, but could not&#xA0;rule them out either.</p>
<p>Current and former US and European officials previously&#xA0;said that weapons supplies, which were being organised and&#xA0;financed by Qatar and Saudi Arabia, were largely limited to guns&#xA0;and a limited number of anti-tank weapons, such as bazookas.</p>
