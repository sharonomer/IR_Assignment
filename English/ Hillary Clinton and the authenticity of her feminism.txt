<p>&#x201C;You can be completely &#x2026; unenthusiastic about Hillary Clinton and still be a feminist&#x201D; <a class="internallink" href="https://twitter.com/sarahjeong/status/654514620946771968" target="_blank">tweeted</a> Vice contributing editor Sarah Jeong. The blunt sentiment came on the heels of Clinton&#x2019;s strong performance in the first Democratic primary debate, striking a particularly disheartening note for a candidate who is losing ground with the one constituency that ought to be her own.</p>
<p>A CNN-ORC poll shows Clinton as experiencing a <a class="internallink" href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/09/13/why-are-women-ditching-hillary.html" target="_blank">nationwide slide</a> among female voters from 75 percent in December&#xA0;2014, down to 51 percent in August 2015.</p>
<p>Eight years after her first presidential bid, her campaign narrative is taking a familiar turn: Hillary Clinton now has a &#x201C;woman&#x201D; problem. The headlines are eerily similar, as are the reasons offered for the disillusionment.</p>

<p>Feminists are still unhappy as ever with her voting record. Clinton&#x2019;s controversial vote to authorise the Iraq war was held against her in 2008. Today, it&#x2019;s her late and grudging support for gay marriage. More damaging, however, are the continuing issues with her character.</p>
<p>A Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll conducted in August <a class="internallink" href="http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2015/08/04/hillary-clinton-loses-ground-with-white-women-wsjnbc-poll/" target="_blank">found that</a> just 34 percent of white women have a positive view of her, and 58 percent of women in a <a class="internallink" href="http://www.foxnews.com/politics/interactive/2015/08/14/fox-news-poll-iran-deal-and-clinton-emails/" target="_blank">Fox News poll </a>say that Clinton &#x201C;knowingly lied&#x201D; with regards to the ongoing email controversy surrounding her time as secretary of state. Women don&#x2019;t seem to trust Hillary.<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Feminist expression</strong></p>
<p>Authenticity has remained the great albatross of Clinton&#x2019;s political career. In her book, titled &#x201C;Hillary Clinton in the News: Gender and Authenticity in American Politics&#x201D;, Shawn Parry-Giles argues that that the mainstream media&#x2019;s judgement of her character is based on a gender double-bind: The press first positioned the &#x201C;real Hillary&#x201D; as a polarising feminist with &#x201C;likability&#x201D; issues, and then used that very image to question her authenticity over and again.</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p>The &apos;real Hillary&apos; was and remains a white, middle-class feminist, and of a generation that was taught too well that glass ceilings could be broken - but only by mastering the rules written and administered by men, and by pushing, but only so fast and so far.</p>
			<p class="quote-author"> </p>
		</blockquote>
		
<p>The result is an extended media narrative driven forward by a series of &#x201C;makeovers&#x201D;, real or perceived, each of which has served to confirm the unreliability of Clinton&#x2019;s public persona.</p>
<p>The woman who told CBS&#x2019; 60 Minutes back in 1992, &#x201C;You know, I am not sitting here, some little woman standing by her man&#x201D; would spend great many years as the&#xA0;first lady doing just that &#x2013; and being pilloried for it.</p>
<p>Decades later, Bill&#x2019;s duplicity has become damning evidence of Hillary&#x2019;s unreliability, with Republican leader Lindsey Graham sniping, &#x201C;I am fluent in Clinton-speak. When Bill says he didn&#x2019;t have sex with that woman, he did &#x2026; When she tells us: &#x2018;Trust me, you&#x2019;ve got all the emails you need,&#x2019; we haven&#x2019;t even scratched the surface.&#x201D;</p>
<p>The greater irony is that the woman who was deemed too &#x201C;liberated&#x201D; back in 1992 has, as a presidential candidate, been deemed &#x201C;not feminist enough&#x201D;, as Slate&#x2019;s Meghan O&#x2019;Rourke <a class="internallink" href="http://www.slate.com/articles/double_x/xxfactor_xxtra/2008/06/death_of_a_saleswoman.html" target="_blank">put it</a> in her post-mortem of the 2008 bid.</p>
<p>Harsh words that Clinton seems to have taken fully to heart given her roaring, <a class="internallink" href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/clinton-steps-up-efforts-to-woo-women-voters-1441927978" target="_blank">unambiguous embrace</a> of the F-word in 2015. But this full-throated tom-tomming of her gender has played as yet another strategic course correction.</p>
<p>So when Clinton <a class="internallink" href="http://www.salon.com/2015/09/29/hillary_clinton_opens_up_to_lena_dunham_im_a_feminist_and_i_say_it_whenever_im_asked/" target="_blank">unequivocally told</a> Girls&#x2019; star Lena Dunham, &#x201C;I&#x2019;m a feminist, and I say it whenever I&#x2019;m asked&#x201D;, it was dismissed by women pundits like Daily Beast&#x2019;s Lizzie Crocker as &#x201C;political pandering at its most transparent&#x201D;.<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Hitting the glass ceiling</strong></p>
<p>Parry-Giles and other Hillary sympathisers are entirely right when they argue that the <a class="internallink" href="https://books.google.co.in/books?id=VbkPBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA25&amp;lpg=PA25&amp;dq=feminists+hillary+authenticity&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=h4k5OqlUZ4&amp;sig=WpMk0zuxNQCMsDxoWft5jXOhOJM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CDUQ6AEwBGoVChMIzN7G95fLyAIVEHCOCh1vuABj#v=onepage&amp;q=feminists%20hillary%20authenticity&amp;f=false" target="_blank">demand for authenticity</a>&#xA0;places a disproportionate and unfair burden on minority candidates aspiring for the highest office.</p>

<p>The bar is far lower for white men like, say, George W Bush who can leverage the most synthetic form of authenticity &#x2013; be it cutting brush at a Texas ranch or swaggering in a flight suit &#x2013; to sell themselves as the &#x201C;real thing&#x201D;. But the greater and more intractable dilemma may well be that a 67-year-old Hillary Clinton&#x2019;s politics are, in fact, authentic.</p>
<p>The &#x201C;real Hillary&#x201D; was and remains a white, middle-class feminist, and of a generation that was taught too well that glass ceilings could be broken &#x2013; but only by mastering the rules written and administered by men, and by pushing, but only so fast and so far.</p>
<p>Cast in this light, a political history of political realignments can instead be seen as the efforts of a ferociously ambitious woman of her time to get ahead by doing what was required of her, whether it was settling for a political partnership instead of a career, or running as a tough centrist to earn her Senate seat, and again in a bid for the presidency.</p>
<p>Now, it is unlikely that the 61-year-old Carly Fiorina reached the top echelons of corporate America without making considerable concessions of her own &#x2013; except that these were not played out in the white-hot glare of media scrutiny.</p>

<p>It is also unlikely that an older Barack Obama with a longer political career would not have made the many compromises that were required of black politicians before him &#x2013; or been quite as he&#x2019;s been able to be so as to write his own story, and therefore author his authenticity.</p>
<p>The fact is that Hillary&#x2019;s problem of authenticity is as much generational as it is personal. Here&#x2019;s a woman who diligently learned to colour inside the lines, only to find that the lines themselves have shifted.</p>
<p>This, then, is the tragedy of Hillary: Just as she has finally reached a point where she can own her feminism, it has been deemed outdated and inauthentic by the very same women whom she aspired to represent.<strong><em></em></strong></p>
