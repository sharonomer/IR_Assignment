<p>The speaker of the Shura Council, Egypt&#x2019;s upper house of parliament, said the new appointments would be announced later on Monday, reported the government-owned press. </p>
<p>Among those to be replaced are Ibrahim Nafie, 74, editor of Al-Ahram and Ibrahim Saada, 68, of Akhbar al-Youm. Both men were appointed by late president Anwar Sadat, in 1979 and 1978 respectively. </p>
<p>The two men along with other editors face lawsuits for remaining in their positions long after official retirement age. Retirement age for government employees is 60 years old. </p>
<p><strong>Entrenched&#xA0;</strong> </p>
<p>Saada, who also serves as chairman of the board of directors for semi-official Akhbar al-Yom newspaper, complained in a column last month of an &#x201C;unethical&#x201D; media campaign against leaders of the state-guided media. </p>
<p>The change in management is not expected to lead to a change in the tone of the newspapers and magazines that make up the government-owned press. The likely candidates to replace the old editors are also known for their loyalty to the state. </p>
<p>Critics say that by its nature, state-owned media contradicts reforms that some Middle Eastern governments like Egypt&#x2019;s say they are committed to making. </p>
<p><strong>Media stirrings</strong></p>
<p>Opposition and independent dailies and weeklies have embarrassed the conservative government press and media by covering the political changes occurring in Egypt. </p>
<p>Most news featuring opposition groups and their leaders are largely ignored or trivialised by the official press. </p>
<p>With presidential and parliament elections due later this year, there has been an unprecedented spate of protests in Egypt calling for an end to the rule of 77-year-old President Hosni Mubarak, who is widely expected to run again. </p>
