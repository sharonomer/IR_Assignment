<p>Barack Obama made history when he was elected the United States&#x2019; first African-American president in November 2008, and he swept to re-election with a victory over Republican Mitt Romney in 2012.</p>
<p>In a speech to supporters in Chicago after winning the election, Obama pledged to work with Democratic and Republican leaders to reduce the nation&#x2019;s federal deficit, fix the tax code, reform immigration and reduce the nation&#x2019;s dependence on foreign oil.</p>
<p>Obama&#x2019;s first term in office had been dominated by the passage of his Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, colloquially known as &#x201C;Obamacare&#x201D;, which he signed into law despite fierce Republican opposition.</p>
<p>Obama also ordered the bailout of the country&#x2019;s&#xA0;struggling&#xA0;car industry in 2009 and signed into law a repeal of the military&#x2019;s controversial &#x201C;don&#x2019;t ask, don&#x2019;t tell&#x201D; policy preventing gay people&#xA0;from serving.</p>
<p>He also signed into law the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, which tightened regulation of the&#xA0;financial&#xA0;system.</p>
<p>On the international stage, Obama has withdrawn US troops from Iraq, a conflict he opposed from the beginning, although thousands of US troops remain in Afghanistan.</p>
<p>The president&#xA0;has failed to close the detention centre at Guantanamo Bay, as he had promised in 2008.</p>
<p>In 2011, the president ordered a team of Navy SEALs to kill Osama bin Laden, the leader of al-Qaeda,&#xA0;at his compound in Pakistan.</p>
<p><strong>Beginnings</strong></p>
<p>The son of a Kenyan father and&#xA0;US mother, Obama was born in Hawaii in 1961.</p>

<p>After his parents&#x2019; divorce, his mother remarried and he lived in Indonesia for several years.</p>
<p>Obama&#xA0;later&#xA0;obtained his degree in New York and spent several years working for church groups assisting the poor in Chicago in the midwestern state of Illinois.</p>
<p>Eventually, like several other presidential candidates, he entered the legal profession, becoming the first African-American president of the prestigious <em>Harvard Law Review</em> while obtaining his law degree.</p>
<p>He then returned to Chicago, teaching and working as a civil rights lawyer before entering the Illinois state senate in 1997.</p>
<p><strong>Path to power</strong></p>
<p>In 2004, Obama was elected to the US senate, only the third African-American to achieve such a post since the US&#x2019; Reconstruction era of the late 19th century.</p>
<p>Not long afterwards, Obama delivered the keynote speech at the Democratic Party&#x2019;s annual convention in&#xA0;Boston, Massachusetts, in which he&#xA0;criticised George Bush, the US president at the time, and called for&#xA0;an end to the Iraq war.</p>
<p>The speech sparked national interest in the young senator, and soon led&#xA0;to&#xA0;a wave of queries from the media over whether he would announce his candidacy for the Democratic presidential nomination.</p>
<p>When he finally did so, there was a media frenzy. The young, photogenic senator was feted by many as the new face of the Democrats.</p>
<p>But he only secured the nomination after a long and at times bitter presidential primary campaign against rival Hillary Clinton, the New York senator and former first lady.</p>
<p>After he won the presidency, she accepted his offer to become secretary of state.</p>
<p><strong>Four years on<br></strong></p>
<p>The 44th US president took office with an approval rating of more than 80 per cent. As his first term draws to a close, however, his approval ratings have hovered slightly below 50 per cent.</p>
<p>Although the unemployment rate fell below&#xA0;eight per cent in September, for the first time since Obama took office, it is still high by historical standards.</p>
<p>National polls show&#xA0;the president&#xA0;running roughly even with his Republican opponent, former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney, although Obama has small leads in some critical swing states such as Ohio.</p>
<p>Some speculate that Obama&#x2019;s response to Hurricane Sandy, a &#x2018;super storm&#x2019; that hit the East Coast a week before election day, may have given him a boost in the polls.</p>
<p>One exit poll found two-thirds of voters cited Obama&#x2019;s response to the storm as a factor in their vote.</p>
