<p>Turkey has condemned remarks made by US Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden criticising President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and calling for support for the Turkish leader&#x2019;s opponents.</p>
<p>Biden made the comments in an interview filmed by the New York Times in December, but a video of the remarks only appeared on Saturday before going viral on social media.</p>
<p>Asked about Erdogan, Biden described the Turkish president as an &#x201C;autocrat&#x201D;, criticised his policy towards the Kurds, and advocated supporting the Turkish opposition.</p>
<p>&#x201C;What I think we should be doing is taking a very different approach to him now, making it clear that we support opposition leadership,&#x201D; Biden said.</p>
<p>&#x201C;He has to pay a price,&#x201D; Biden said at the time, adding that Washington should embolden Turkish opposition leaders &#x201C;to be able to take on and defeat Erdogan. Not by a coup, not by a coup, but by the electoral process.&#x201D;</p>
<p>The comments did not provoke much reaction when they were published in January, but the video of the interview triggered an angry response from Turkey.</p>
<p>&#x201C;The analysis of Turkey by @JoeBiden is based on pure ignorance, arrogance and hypocrisy,&#x201D; Erdogan&#x2019;s spokesman Ibrahim Kalin tweeted.</p>

<p>But if you still think you can try, be our guest.</p>
<p>You will pay the price.</p>

<p>&#x201C;The days of ordering Turkey around are over. But if you still think you can try, be our guest. You will pay the price.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Erdogan&#x2019;s communications director Fahrettin Altun said the comments &#x201C;reflect games and an interventionist approach towards Turkey&#x201D; and are inconsistent with current diplomatic relations.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Nobody can attack our nation&#x2019;s will and democracy or question the legitimacy of our President, who was elected by popular vote,&#x201D; Altun said on Twitter.</p>
<p>&#x201C;We believe that these unbecoming statements which have no place in diplomacy by a presidential candidate from our NATO ally, the United States, are unacceptable to the current administration too,&#x201D; he added.</p>
<p>Biden&#x2019;s statements also embarrassed Erdogan&#x2019;s opponents, who the Turkish government regularly accuses of being in the pay of foreign powers.</p>
<p>Several officials of the main opposition CHP party quickly distanced themselves from Biden&#x2019;s remarks, calling for &#x201C;respect for the sovereignty of Turkey&#x201D;.</p>
<p>Erdogan has worked to cultivate a personal relationship with current US President Donald Trump &#x2013; who is running for re-election in November this year &#x2013; and often lashes out at Trump&#x2019;s predecessor, Barack Obama.</p>
<p>Biden &#x2013; who is expected to be Trump&#x2019;s opponent in the upcoming election &#x2013; was Obama&#x2019;s vice president.</p>
<p>Relations between Ankara and Washington were strained during Obama&#x2019;s second term, particularly because of disagreements over Syria and growing international criticism over freedoms and rights in Turkey.</p>
<p>While Trump and Erdogan speak regularly, diplomatic relations have been strained over Ankara&#x2019;s purchase of Russian air defences, policy in Syria and over US charges against a Turkish state bank for allegedly helping Iran evade sanctions.</p>
