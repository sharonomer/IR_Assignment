<p>Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, the&#xA0;general who ousted Egypt&#x2019;s first freely elected leader last July, has declared&#xA0;his candidacy for a presidential election he is&#xA0;expected to easily win.&#xA0;</p>
<p>Wearing military fatigues and <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2014/03/sisi-resignation-speech-full-2014326201638123905.html">speaking in a nationally televised address </a>, Sisi said it was the last time he would&#xA0;wear an army uniform and that &#x201C;I give up the uniform to defend the nation&#x201D; and run in the elections, which are expected next month.</p>
<p>&#x201C;I have spent all my life as a soldier for the sake of the country &#x2026;&#xA0;I am telling you that I intend to run for the president of Egypt, and this support from you will give me this honour,&#x201D; he said. </p>
<p>Sisi said Egypt was &#x201C;threatened by terrorists&#x201D; and spoke of returning the country to dignity. </p>
<p>&#x201C;It wasn&#x2019;t the army or political forces who ousted the last two regimes; it was you the people. My entering the presidency race doesn&#x2019;t not mean that others shouldn&#x2019;t,&#x201D; he said.</p>
<p>The 59-year-old Sisi is widely expected to win the vote, and restore a&#xA0;tradition of presidents from military background that Egypt had for all but&#xA0;one year since 1952.</p>
<p>He has been the country&#x2019;s most powerful figure since&#xA0;removing President Mohammed Morsi, and Morsi&#x2019;s once politically dominant&#xA0;Muslim Brotherhood has since been declared a terrorist group.</p>
<p>Among his supporters, Sisi is wildly popular. Many see him&#xA0;as the kind of strongman needed to stabilise a country in crisis. But he is reviled by the Islamist opposition as the&#xA0;mastermind of a coup against a freely elected leader.&#xA0;</p>
<p><strong>Celebrations and protests </strong></p>
<p>Following Sisi&#x2019;s announcement, there were protests by supporters of Morsi on the streets of the capital Cairo.&#xA0;</p>
<p>Magdy Karkar, a senior member of a Brotherhood-led coalition organising&#xA0;anti-government protests, said Sisi&#x2019;s candidacy confirms that Morsi&#x2019;s&#xA0;removal was a coup aimed at wrecking democracy, as Islamists have contended.</p>
<p>&#x201C;His running will not achieve stability in Egypt. It&#x2019;s true he has many&#xA0;supporters who love him or even worship him. But on the other hand, there are those who hate General el-Sisi and hold him responsible for the blood that has been shed,&#x201D; Karkar told the Associated Press news agency.</p>
<p>Watching his speech in a coffee shop in Cairo, however, Sabry Ahmed, in his late&#xA0;50s, said Sisi has what Egypt needed.</p>
<p>&#x201C;He is a political man, a military man, and an economics man. He&#xA0;understands in everything regarding the state,&#x201D;he said.</p>
<p>&#x201C;We can&#x2019;t compare&#xA0;him to anyone else. The country needs a strong man of his size.&#x201D;</p>
<p>In the neighborhood where Sisi was born in old Cairo, celebrations&#xA0;broke out as soon as he finished his speech. A distant relative, Mohammed&#xA0;Haroun, cheered: &#x201C;This is the best decision he took in his life.&#x201D;</p>
<p><strong>Death sentence outrage </strong></p>
<p>Commenting on Sisi&#x2019;s candidacy, the United States, a major&#xA0;source of military aid to Egypt, said it did not support individual candidates or parties in Egyptian elections.</p>

<p>&#x201C;As the election process moves forward we urge the Egyptian&#xA0;authorities to ensure that the elections are free, fair, and transparent; that all candidates are able to campaign freely,&#xA0;without fear of harassment or intimidation; and that the views of all the Egyptian people are fully represented,&#x201D; White House&#xA0;National Security Council spokeswoman Bernadette Meehan said in&#xA0;a statement.</p>
<p>Sisi&#x2019;s decision came <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2014/03/201432616156966211.html">amid reports </a>that one person had been killed during protests against Monday&#x2019;s court verdict that sentenced more than 500 alleged Muslim Brotherhood supporters to death.&#xA0;</p>
<p>At least 30 people were wounded in the protests over the ruling that drew criticism from international&#xA0;human rights groups and Western powers.&#xA0;</p>
<p>The authorities have yet to set a date for the presidential&#xA0;election. Leftist politician Hamdeen Sabahi, who came third in the 2012 election, is so far the only other candidate to have stated&#xA0;his intention to run. </p>
<p>General Sedki Sobhi, who holds the post of chief of staff,&#xA0;is expected to replace Sisi as army chief and defence minister.&#xA0;</p>
