<p>Former Egyptian President <a href="/news/2016/06/profile-egypt-deposed-president-mohamed-morsi-160607074148919.html">Mohamed Morsi</a> is being imprisoned in standards lower than those sanctioned by international law, which could lead to an early death, a panel of British MPs and lawyers said.&#xA0;</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.detentionreview.com/drpreport/" target="_parent">report</a> released on Wednesday, the Detention Review Panel (DRP), which was commissioned by Morsi&#x2019;s family, said the former leader is &#x201C;receiving inadequate medical care, particularly&#xA0;inadequate management of his diabetes, and inadequate management of his liver disease&#x201D;.&#xA0;</p>
<p>&#x201C;The consequence of this inadequate care is likely to be rapid deterioration of his long-term conditions, which is likely to lead to premature death,&#x201D; it said.&#xA0;</p>
<p>The panel said the conditions of his detention could meet the threshold for torture in Egyptian and international law. It added that President <a href="/topics/people/abdel-fattah-el-sisi.html">Abdel Fattah el-Sisi</a> &#x201C;could, in principle, be responsible for the crime of torture&#x201D;.&#xA0;</p>

<p>Morsi, 67, <a href="/news/middleeast/2012/06/201262412445190400.html">was democratically elected</a> after Egypt&#x2019;s 2011 revolution. He <a href="/news/middleeast/2013/07/20137319828176718.html">was then deposed</a> following mass protests and a military coup in July 2013.</p>
<p>He served just one year of a four-year term, while the organisation to which he belonged, the <a href="/indepth/features/2017/06/muslim-brotherhood-explained-170608091709865.html">Muslim Brotherhood</a>, has since been outlawed.</p>
<p>Since his removal, Morsi has been tried in several different cases.</p>
<p>In April 2015, he was <a href="/news/2015/04/egypt-morsi-sentenced-150421063227546.html">sentenced to 20 years</a> on charges of&#xA0;ordering the arrest and torture of protesters in clashes outside the presidential palace in 2012.</p>
<p>In September 2016, he was <a href="/news/2017/09/egypt-court-upholds-president-morsi-life-sentence-170916130509759.html">sentenced</a> to another 25 years in prison on charges of passing intelligence to Qatar. In December 2017, Morsi was also <a href="/news/2017/12/morsi-3-years-jail-insulting-judiciary-171230133747483.html">sentenced</a> to three years on charges of insulting the judiciary.&#xA0;</p>
<p>He is now being held at the infamous Tora Prison, also known as Scorpion Prison, where the DRP said he had been held in solitary confinement for about three years.&#xA0;</p>

<p>The panel, led by MP Crispin Blunt, said it was able to gather information about Morsi&#x2019;s detention from several sources, including testimony from Morsi&#x2019;s son as well as medical professionals informed of the former president&#x2019;s condition.&#xA0;</p>
<p>The DRP had originally requested to visit Morsi and assess his detention conditions firsthand, but the panel said it did not hear back from the Egyptian government.&#xA0;</p>
<p>The release of the report cames as Egypt <a href="/news/2018/03/egypt-elections-close-sisi-set-win-180328135457231.html">wrapped up</a> a three-day presidential election, which el-Sisi is expected to win easily.&#xA0;</p>
<p>The National Election Authority cleared el-Sisi and Moussa Mustafa Moussa to run.</p>
<p>Mousa is a little-known politician who joined the race at the last minute after several potential candidates were forced out or arrested.</p>
<p>Mousa had endorsed el-Sisi for a second term and even organised events to help nominate the former military chief up until a week before the nomination deadline.</p>
