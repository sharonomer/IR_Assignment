<p>Joe Biden and Barack Obama are stepping up their attacks on United States President Donald Trump and defending their own time in the White House in a new video depicting their first in-person meeting since&#xA0;the coronavirus outbreak&#xA0;began.</p>
<p>Snippets offered by Biden&#x2019;s campaign showed the pair wearing masks while arriving at an office, then sitting down at a distance from each other to observe&#xA0;social distancing&#xA0;for a bare-faced chat.</p>
<p>The full video will be posted on social media on Thursday, but teasers showed Biden and Obama discussing passing their administration&#x2019;s signature healthcare law and blaming Trump for stoking division and animosity among Americans from the moment he entered the 2016 presidential race.</p>
<p>They were sharply critical of&#xA0;the Republican president&#x2019;s efforts to combat a virus that has&#xA0;killed more than 143,000 people in the US.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Can you imagine standing up when you were president and saying, &#x2018;It&#x2019;s not my responsibility, I take no responsibility&#x2019;?&#x201D;&#xA0;Biden says, offering a line of attack similar to his recent campaign speeches when he asserted that Trump &#x201C;quit&#x201D; on the country and has &#x201C;waved the white flag&#x201D; amid the pandemic.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Those words didn&#x2019;t come out of our mouths while we were in office,&#x201D; Obama replies.</p>
<p>The former president largely stayed out of&#xA0;the once-crowded Democratic primary&#xA0;but&#xA0;endorsed Biden in April, when he was the last candidate standing. Obama hosted a virtual fundraiser for his former vice president last month that&#xA0;raised $7.6m, the most of any Biden campaign event so far. He warned then against Democrats becoming &#x201C;complacent and smug&#x201D;.</p>

<p>The meeting in the video &#x2013; and the Biden campaign promoting it to voters &#x2013; illustrates&#xA0;the larger role Obama is expected to play for&#xA0;the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee&#xA0;in the months before November.</p>
<p>In&#xA0;another excerpt, Biden refers to Trump launching his 2016 campaign at Trump Tower, saying: &#x201C;He ran by deliberately dividing people from the moment he came down that escalator, and I think people are now going, &#x2018;I don&#x2019;t want my kid growing up that way.&apos;&#x201D;</p>
<p>Obama responds that he had confidence in Biden&#x2019;s &#x201C;heart and your character, and the fact that you are going to be able to reassemble the kind of government that cares about people and brings people together&#x201D;.</p>
<p>Another scene&#xA0;features Biden discussing the final months before&#xA0;his son Beau died of brain cancer&#xA0;and recalling thinking &#x201C;to myself, what would happen if his insurance company was able to come in &#x2013; which they could have done before we passed Obamacare &#x2013; and said, &#x2018;You have outrun your insurance.&apos;&#x201D;</p>
<p>Obama says: &#x201C;I couldn&#x2019;t be prouder of what we got done.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Twenty million people have health insurance that didn&#x2019;t have it because of what we did,&#x201D; the former president adds.</p>
