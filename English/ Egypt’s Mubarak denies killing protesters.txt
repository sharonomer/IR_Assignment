<p>Ousted Egyptian president Hosni Mubarak has denied he ordered security forces to kill protesters, as he faced a Cairo court over the deaths of 850 demonstrators during Egypt&#x2019;s 2011 uprising.</p>
<p>Mubarak told the court he never handed down orders to kill protesters.</p>
<p>&#x201C;I, Mohammed Hosni Mubarak, who is standing before you today, never handed down orders for the killing of protesters. I never handed down orders for the killing of Egyptians,&#x201D; he said in his first speech to the court.</p>
<p>&#x201C;I exhausted my life fighting against enemies of the homeland. I would never hand down orders for the killing of a single Egyptian citizen under any circumstances. Or hand down orders to wreak chaos of which I had been warning. I would never hand down orders to cause anarchy or a political vacuum.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Mubarak, his former interior minister Habib al-Adly and several other high-ranking officials are facing charges over the deaths.</p>
<p>The verdict is scheduled to be issued on September 27.</p>
<p>Adly, who has already taken the stand, told the court he made security decisions on the day to limit the number of protesters in Tahrir Square and still believed he was &#x201C;100 percent correct&#x201D;.</p>
<p>&#x201C;It was a wise decision,&#x201D; he told the court.</p>
<p>Mubarak came to power in 1981, taking over after President Anwar Sadat was assassinated.</p>
<p>In January 2011, embolded after seeing people in neighbouring Tunisia overthrow their long-time leader, tens of thousands of Egyptians took to Cairo&#x2019;s Tahrir Square, calling for more jobs, democracy and the end of Mubarak&#x2019;s rule.</p>
<p>Security forces and Mubarak&#x2019;s supporters tried to crush the demonstrations. After 18 days of protests, more than 850 protesters were killed.</p>
<p>On February 11, 2011, his vice president, Omar Suleiman, announced Mubarak&#x2019;s resignation.</p>
<p>A day later, prosecutors ordered Mubarak be placed under detention along with his two sons.</p>
<p>A lengthy trial for corruption and killing protesters during the uprising was held, and more than a year later, Mubarak was found guilty of failing to stop the killing of protesters and jailed for life.</p>
<p>However, the court threw out that conviction at the beginning of last year on technical grounds, and ordered a new trial.</p>
<p>Separately, another court sentenced Mubarak in May to three years for corruption. His sons received four-year terms.&#xA0;</p>
