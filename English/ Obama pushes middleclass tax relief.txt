<p>President Barack Obama has called for a one-year extension of tax cuts for&#xA0;families earning less than $250,000 a year, seeking to put&#xA0;Republicans on the defensive ahead of the November presidential election.</p>
<p>Obama&#x2019;s proposal, which attempts to reinforce his campaign mantra&#xA0;of being a middle-class champion,&#xA0;is unlikely to sway his opponents in&#xA0;Congress, who have argued consistently that the tax cuts passed by Obama&#x2019;s Republican predecessor&#xA0;should stay in place for everyone, including wealthy Americans.</p>
<p>White House spokesman Jay Carney told reporters after Obama&#x2019;s remarks on Monday that the president would veto any bill that extended the tax cuts across the board.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Let&#x2019;s not hold the vast majority of Americans and our&#xA0;entire economy hostage while we debate the merits of another tax&#xA0;cut for the wealthy,&#x201D; Obama said at the White House, standing in&#xA0;front of a riser filled with people who he said would be hurt if&#xA0;their tax cuts were not extended.</p>
<p>Republicans charge that allowing taxes to rise for higher-earning Americans would hurt small business owners who are helping to&#xA0;create jobs in a tough economy, but Obama argued that 97 per cent of all small business&#xA0;owners would fall under the $250,000-a-year income threshold.</p>
<p>&#x201C;This isn&#x2019;t about taxing job creators, this is about helping&#xA0;job creators,&#x201D; Obama said.</p>
<p>Whether it gains traction or not, the Democratic incumbent&#x2019;s&#xA0;move achieves several political goals.</p>
<p>It shifts the campaign conversation &#x2013; at least for a day &#x2013;&#xA0;from last week&#x2019;s meager jobs report and his handling of the&#xA0;economy to &#x201C;tax fairness&#x201D; and inequality in&#xA0;America.</p>
<p>It burnishes Obama&#x2019;s message of being the candidate who&#xA0;backs the middle class while Republicans and their presumptive&#xA0;presidential nominee, Mitt Romney, favour the wealthy.</p>
<p>It also sets a baseline for what is likely to be a&#xA0;months-long debate about deficit reduction.</p>
<p><strong>Obama &#x2018;doesn&#x2019;t have a clue&#x2019;</strong></p>
<p>The tax cuts enacted by Republican President George W. Bush,&#xA0;Obama&#x2019;s predecessor, will expire on January 1 without congressional&#xA0;action, part of a so-called fiscal cliff that could hit the US&#xA0;economy alongside deep automatic spending cuts.</p>
<p>Romney has suggested Congress wait to act on the issue until&#xA0;January, when he hopes to take office.</p>
<p>His campaign said on Monday Obama&#x2019;s move would amount to a&#xA0;&#x201C;massive tax increase&#x201D; on families, job creators and small&#xA0;businesses.</p>
<p>&#x201C;It just proves again that the president doesn&#x2019;t have a clue&#xA0;how to get America working again and help the middle class,&#x201D;&#xA0;Romney spokeswoman Andrea Saul said.</p>
<p>Aside from the Republican reaction, Obama&#x2019;s move holds&#xA0;political pitfalls among his fellow Democrats, who are divided&#xA0;about how to address the issue.</p>
<p>House of Representatives Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi has&#xA0;suggested that the income threshold for extending tax cuts be&#xA0;set at $1 million a year rather than the $250,000 limit Obama&#xA0;wants.</p>
<p>Some Democrats oppose any extension, while others are wary&#xA0;of allowing taxes to rise for higher earners because of its&#xA0;economic impact.</p>
