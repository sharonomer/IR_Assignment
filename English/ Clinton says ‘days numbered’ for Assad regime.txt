<p>Hillary Clinton, the US secretary of state,&#xA0;warned that time was running out for the Syrian regime and it needed to start a&#xA0;political transition to save the country from a &#x201C;catastrophic assault&#x201D;.</p>
<p>&#x201C;It should be abundantly clear to those who support the Assad regime their days are numbered,&#x201D; Clinton told reporters on the sidelines of a conference on Afghanistan in Tokyo on Sunday.</p>
<p>But she acknowledged that efforts, led by UN-Arab League envoy Kofi Annan, to get the regime of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad to halt its brutal crackdown on the opposition were proving difficult.</p>
<p>Annan is expected to visit Damascus on Monday, Syria&#x2019;s foreign ministry said.</p>
<p>&#x201C;It is confirmed that Mr Annan will visit Damascus, within the framework of his mission, for discussions with the Syrian leadership on the subject of the six-point plan,&#x201D; ministry spokesman Jihad Makdissi said.</p>
<p>Annan himself in an interview with the French daily <em>Le Monde</em> said his six-point plan to end hostilities in Syria had not been successful so far, and there was no guarantee that it would succeed.</p>
<p>Activists say more than 17,000 people have now died since the uprising began in March last year.</p>
<p>&#x201C;What Kofi Annan said should be a wake-up call to everyone because he&#xA0;acknowledged that there has not been movement by the Syrian regime in&#xA0;accordance with the six-point plan,&#x201D; Clinton said.</p>
<p>The top US diplomat added: &#x201C;The sooner there can be an end to the violence&#xA0;and a begetting of a political transition process, not only will fewer people&#xA0;die, but there&#x2019;s a chance to save the Syrian state from a catastrophic assault&#xA0;that would be dangerous not only to the country, but the region.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Clinton was speaking after attending talks in Paris on Friday in which&#xA0;countries pledged to increase pressure on Assad to step down by seeking a tough&#xA0;UN resolution backed by a threat of sanctions.</p>
<p>She had also met with members of the Syrian opposition leading efforts to&#xA0;topple Assad, whose family has ruled the Arab nation for four decades.</p>
<p>&#x201C;There&#x2019;s no doubt that the opposition is getting more effective in their&#xA0;defence of themselves and is going on the offence against the Syrian military&#xA0;and the Syrian government&#x2019;s militias,&#x201D; Clinton told reporters Sunday.</p>
<p>She also pointed to a number of high-level defections, warning the Assad&#xA0;regime that &#x201C;the sand is running out of the hour glass&#x201D;.</p>
<p>&#x201C;We want to make clear to the Syrian regime that they need to be willing to&#xA0;end the violence and start the serious business of a political transition,&#x201D;&#xA0;Clinton added.</p>
<p><strong>Towns attacked </strong></p>
<p>Meanwhile, Syrian forces attacked Aleppo and Deir Ezzor provinces as at least 13 people, including 10 civilians, were killed across the country on Sunday, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said.</p>
<p>The violence followed a bloody day in which 77 people were killed on Saturday, among them 39 civilians, 25 soldiers and 13 rebels, according to the Britain-based watchdog.</p>
<p>On Sunday, regime forces shelled the villages of Miadin and Al-Tabeya Jazeera in the eastern province of Deir Ezzor, killing three people, two of them children.</p>
<p>Heavy shelling was also reported in Aazaz town in the northern province of Aleppo from midnight and into the morning, with explosions heard from far outside the town.</p>
<p>Six people were killed in gunfire in the village of Sahel al-Ghab in the central province of Hama, while a woman was killed in random shooting in the Damascus countryside.</p>
<p>In Idlib province, in northwestern Syria, the army killed two rebels in the town of Khan Sheikhun, the watchdog said, citing activists.</p>
<p>And a rebel was killed in the southern province of Daraa, cradle of a 16-month uprising against Assad.</p>
<p>More than 17,000 people, including 11,815 civilians, have been killed in Syria since the outbreak of the revolt in March 2011, the Observatory reported Saturday.</p>
<p>The total also includes 4,316 members of the army and security services and 881 deserters, Observatory director Rami Abdel-Rahman said by phone.</p>
<p>Rebels who are not army defectors are included in the civilian toll.</p>
