<p>Mohamed Morsi, the Egyptian president-elect, took a symbolic oath of office during a rousing speech in Cairo, promising dignity and social justice to a crowd of tens of thousands gathered in Tahrir Square.</p>
<p>He swore to uphold the constitution and &#x201C;the republican system&#x201D;, reciting the words of an oath which he will formally take on Saturday morning in front of the supreme constitutional court. &#x201C;I will look after the interests of the people and protect the independence of the nation and the safety of its territory,&#x201D; he said.</p>
<p>Morsi opened his speech by addressing himself to &#x201C;the Muslims and Christians of Egypt,&#x201D; and promised to preserve a civil state.</p>
<p>&#x201C;We will complete the journey in a civil state, a nationalist state, a constitutional state, a modern state,&#x201D; he told the crowd, to applause and cheers.</p>
<p>Morsi, a&#xA0;former Muslim Brotherhood official, promised to end torture and discrimination, and to deliver social justice for millions of Egyptians.</p>
<p>He also issued several challenges to the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces (SCAF), Egypt&#x2019;s military rulers.</p>
<p>He insisted that &#x201C;no institution will be above the people,&#x201D; critiquing an army which has sought to shield itself from parliamentary oversight.&#xA0;&#x201C;You are the source of authority,&#x201D; he told the crowd.</p>
<p>Morsi&#xA0;also vowed to work for the release of civilians arrested by the army since the revolution; more than 12,000 people have been tried by military tribunals since February 2011, according to local human rights groups.</p>
<p><strong>&#x2018;I don&#x2019;t fear anyone but God&#x2019;</strong></p>
<p>The symbolic oath was a way for Morsi to defuse a lingering political problem.&#xA0;The president traditionally takes the oath of office before parliament, but the legislature was dissolved earlier this month by a&#xA0;high court ruling.</p>
<p>In response, the&#xA0;ruling SCAF shifted the venue to the court, but Morsi was reluctant to take the oath there, for fear of appearing to support the court&#x2019;s ruling.</p>

<p>The Muslim Brotherhood&#x2019;s Freedom and Justice Party had the largest share of seats in parliament, and has vowed to fight its dissolution.</p>
<p>Much of his speech took a populist tone. He spoke for several minutes from behind a lectern, then stepped away to address the crowd more directly.</p>
<p>At one point, he lifted up his suit jacket to show he was not wearing body armour.&#xA0;&#x201C;I don&#x2019;t fear my people,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;I don&#x2019;t fear anyone but God.&#x201D;</p>
<p>He also spoke briefly about Egypt&#x2019;s foreign relations, promising to improve relations with neighbours in Africa and the Middle East, and to &#x201C;keep the peace&#x201D;.</p>
<p>&#x201C;We will never give up the rights of Egyptians abroad,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;Respecting the will of the people is the basis of our foreign relations.&#x201D;</p>
<p>The president-elect tried to reassure several groups worried about what a Muslim Brotherhood presidency means for Egypt. He made several mentions of &#x201C;artists and intellectuals&#x201D;, promising to make Egypt a cultural and artistic leader.</p>
<p>On the other hand, in a remark sure to worry Western leaders, Morsi also promised to work to free Omar Abdel Rahman, the Egyptian cleric currently serving a life sentence in the United States for planning the 1993 attack on the World Trade Center. His pledge was most likely a sop to the Salafi groups which have made Abdel Rahman&#x2019;s release a prominent issue.</p>
<p><strong>Not the end of military rule</strong></p>
<p>Morsi will formally take his oath on Saturday morning, and then travel to Cairo University to deliver an inauguration speech.</p>
<p>He will take office amidst a great deal of political uncertainty. He swore to uphold the constitution, but Egypt still does not have a permanent constitution, only a series of &#x201C;constitutional declarations&#x201D; issued by the ruling generals.</p>
<p>Shortly before parliament was dissolved, lawmakers appointed a 100-member assembly to draft a new constitution. That panel, too, may be dissolved by court order, though the administrative court hearing the case says it will not issue a ruling until July.</p>
<p>The generals are keen to portray Saturday&#x2019;s swearing-in ceremony as a formal handover of control to a civilian government. But SCAF will continue to wield a great deal of power, perhaps more than Morsi: The military council will control legislative authority, and the Egyptian budget, until a new parliament is elected later this year.</p>
<p>It is also unclear how much power Morsi will have over the military or Egypt&#x2019;s sprawling security services, which spent decades oppressing the Muslim Brotherhood.</p>
