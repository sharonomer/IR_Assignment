<p>The UN has called for a &#x201C;thorough and transparent investigation&#x201D; into the death of <a class="InternalLink" href="/news/2019/06/obituary-egypt-freely-elected-president-mohamed-morsi-190617161921218.html">Mohamed Morsi</a> in court, as thousands of people across the Middle East paid their respects to <a href="/topics/country/egypt.html">Egypt</a>&#x2018;s former president.</p>
<p>The UN human rights office on Tuesday said the investigation should encompass all aspects of his treatment during nearly six years of his incarceration.</p>
<p>Egypt&#x2019;s first democratically elected president was buried in a small family ceremony early on Tuesday a day after he suffered a fatal heart attack in a Cairo court, his sons said.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Concerns have been raised regarding the conditions of Mr Morsi&#x2019;s detention, including access to adequate medical care, as well as sufficient access to his lawyers and family &#x2026;,&#x201D; UN human rights spokesman Rupert Colville said in a statement.</p>

<p>&#x201C;The investigation should be carried out by a judicial or other competent authority that is independent of the detaining authority and mandated to conduct prompt, impartial and effective investigations into the circumstances and causes of his death,&#x201D; he said.</p>
<p>Morsi was overthrown on July 3, 2013, after barely in power for a year in a coup staged by current President <a href="/topics/people/abdel-fattah-el-sisi.html">Abdel Fattah el-Sisi </a>and placed under house arrest before being moved to prison.</p>
<h2><span>Erdogan attends prayer</span></h2>
<p>Morsi&#x2019;s death has brought an outpouring of condolences from around the Middle East.</p>
<p>&#x201C;I mourn, for myself and all the free people of the world, the death of a great striver on the path of freedom,&#x201D; said Tawakkol Karman, joint recipient of Nobel Peace Prize.</p>
<p>Al Jazeera Jamal Elshayyal, reporting from Doha said that hundreds of mourners gathered at a local mosque to pay their respects to the former president.</p>
<p>&#x201C;The presence of Khaled Meshaal, the former leader of the Palestinian resistance movement, Hamas, is a testament that Morsi is seen as a champion of other causes such as struggle for freedom in Palestine,&#x201D; he said.</p>
<p>Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan <a class="InternalLink" href="/news/2019/06/mosques-turkey-hold-funeral-prayers-mohamed-morsi-honour-190618113458552.html">attended a prayer service</a> in Istanbul for the former Egyptian president.</p>
<p>At Istanbul&#x2019;s Fatih mosque, where thousands joined in prayers, Erdogan called Morsi a &#x201C;martyr&#x201D; and blamed Egypt&#x2019;s &#x201C;tyrants&#x201D; for his death, adding that he didn&#x2019;t believe that Morsi died of natural causes.</p>

</div>
<p>&#x201C;I don&#x2019;t believe that this was a normal death,&#x201D; Erdogan, a key supporter of Morsi, said.</p>
<p>The Turkish president also denounced the Egyptian authorities for burying Morsi discreetly, with only a small number of family members and confidants present.</p>
<p><span>Journalists were kept away from the burial service in Cairo, while a&#xA0;</span>family request to bury him in his home town was turned down.</p>
<p>But&#xA0;mourners still gathered in the former president&#x2019;s home province of Sharqiya to pay their respects.</p>

<p>Exiled Egyptian opposition politician Ayman Nour called Morsi &#x201C;a martyr who was killed deliberately&#x201D;.</p>
<p>Amr Darrag, a senior member of Brotherhood&#x2019;s political party who also lives in exile, said: &#x201C;Sisi is the murderer and there must be a transparent and independent international investigation.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Rights bodies, Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch, have also called for a credible investigation into Morsi&#x2019;s death.</p>
<p>&#x201C;The government of Egypt today bears responsibility for his death, given their failure to provide him with adequate medical care or basic prisoner rights,&#x201D; HRW said in a statement to Al Jazeera.</p>
<p>&#x201C;He&#x2019;s been in prison and treated worse than the already terrible conditions for Egypt&#x2019;s prisoners,&#x201D; Sarah Leah Whitson, executive director of the HRW&#x2019;s Middle East and North Africa division, told Al Jazeera, decrying Morsi&#x2019;s &#x201C;terrible but entirely predictable&#x201D; death.</p>
<p>&#x201C;The Egyptian government has known very clearly about his declining medical state. He had lost a great deal of weight, he had fainted in court a number of times and was being kept in almost around-the-clock solitary confinement.&#x201D;</p>

<p>A leading member of the Muslim Brotherhood group, Morsi won Egypt&#x2019;s first free presidential election in 2012, a year after an uprising that toppled longtime leader Hosni Mubarak.</p>
<p>Turkey&#x2019;s ruling AK Party supported Morsi&#x2019;s government and many Brotherhood members and supporters have fled to Turkey since its activities were banned in Egypt in 2013.</p>
<p>&#x201C;There are Arab dissidents and journalists who have been residing in Turkey since the Arab Spring began and people are here to give support for Morsi&#x2019;s cause,&#x201D; Al Jazeera&#x2019;s Sinem Koseoglu, reporting from Istanbul&#x2019;s Fatih Mosque, said.&#xA0;</p>
<p>At the time of his death, Morsi, 67, faced a host of legal charges, which he, along with many human rights groups and independent observers, said were politically motivated.</p>
<p>Thousands of members of now-outlawed Muslim Brotherhood organisation, who were arrested in the crackdown following the 2013 coup, are still languishing in jails.</p>
<p>Egypt&#x2019;s government has dismissed accusations that the former president was badly treated.</p>
