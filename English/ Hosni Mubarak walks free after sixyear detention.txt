<p>Six years after his ouster, Egypt&#x2019;s ex-President Hosni Mubarak has been released from detention after being cleared of inciting the killings of hundreds of protesters in 2011.</p>
<p>Mubarak, 88, on Friday left a military hospital in Cairo&#x2019;s southern suburb of Maadi where he had been held in custody and went to his home in the upscale Heliopolis district under heavy security.&#xA0;</p>
<p>His lawyer, Farid el-Deeb, told the Egyptian newspaper al-Masry al-Youm&#xA0;that he&#xA0;<span>celebrated his release</span><span>&#xA0;with</span><span>&#xA0;breakfast his wife&#xA0;</span><span>Suzanne and their two sons,&#xA0;Alaa and Gamal.</span></p>

<p><span>He had been sentenced to life in 2012 but an appeals court dismissed the charges two years later.</span></p>
<p><span>Timothy Kaldas, a non-resident fellow at the Tahrir Institute for Middle East Policy, told Al Jazeera that it was unlikely &#x201C;both now or any time in the foreseeable future that anyone will be prosecuted for the murders.</span></p>
<p>&#x201C;Mubarak being in or out of prison doesn&#x2019;t change the fact that the military the took control in Egypt in 1952 continues to rule Egypt today.</p>
<p>&#x201C;[Mubarak&#x2019;s] role in Egyptian politics is of limited consequence today, [but] there&#x2019;s a real sense of injustice that while many revolutionaries are in prison &#x2013; he has walked free.&#x201D;</p>

<p>The ouster of Mubarak, who ruled Egypt for 29 years, led to the country&#x2019;s first free election but the winner, Muslim Brotherhood leader Mohamed Morsi, was overthrown in a military coup in 2013.</p>
<p>Army chief Abdel Fattah el-Sisi&#xA0;has since waged a fierce crackdown on Morsi and the Muslim Brotherhood with human rights groups claiming as many as 60,000 political prisoners currently languish in Egypt&#x2019;s jails.</p>
<p>In contrast, Mubarak-era figures are slowly being cleared of charges and a series of laws curtailing political freedoms have raised fears among activists that the old leadership is regaining influence.</p>
<p>&#x201C;As Hosni Mubarak goes free in Egypt, thousands of prisoners still languish in horrific prison conditions,&#x201D; <span>Harriet McCulloch, a deputy director at human rights organisation Reprieve, told Al Jazeera.</span></p>
<p>&#x201C;Many face the death penalty on charges relating to protests, in mass trials that make a mockery of due process,&#x201D;&#xA0;<span>McCulloch added.</span></p>
<p>&#x201C;Some were arrested as children &#x2013; people like Irish citizen&#xA0;<a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/03/hunger-strike-deteriorating-ibrahim-halawa-health-170301145810198.html">Ibrahim Halawa</a>, who has suffered terrible abuses in jail. The Sisi government must now show that Egypt&#x2019;s justice system is worthy of the name and release Ibrahim, and the hundreds like him.&#x201D;</p>
<p>A former air force chief and vice president, Mubarak became president after fighters who had infiltrated the army shot dead president Anwar Sadat during a military parade in 1981.</p>
<p>Mubarak, then vice president, was metres away from Sadat during the attack and was shot in the hand. He was sworn in as president eight days later.</p>
