<p><a href="/topics/country/egypt.html">Egypt</a>&#x2018;s parliament has passed proposed constitutional amendments that could see President <a href="/topics/people/abdel-fattah-el-sisi.html">Abdel-Fattah el-Sisi</a> remain in power until 2030, according to state media.</p>
<p>The vote on Tuesday sends the changes to a public referendum that will<span>&#xA0;likely take place before early May when the Muslim holy month of Ramadan starts.</span></p>
<p>Critics have decried the proposals as another step back to authoritarianism, eight years after a pro-democracy uprising ended put an end to <a href="/focus/2009/12/200912693048491779.html">Hosni Mubarak</a>&#x2018;s decades-long rule.</p>
<p>The amendments approved by the 596-member parliament, which is dominated by pro-Sisi politicians, include allowing the general-turned-president to extend his current term by two years and stand for another six-year mandate.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Today, we are concluding what we started in February,&#x201D; Speaker Ali Abdel-Al said at the beginning of the session.</p>
<p>&#x201C;In this great day, we offer to the Egyptian people a draft bill of the constitutional amendments.&#x201D;</p>
<h2>Human rights record</h2>
<p>In recent weeks, large posters encouraging people to vote in the referendum and back the changes have been splattered across Egypt&#x2019;s capital, Cairo, including in the central Tahrir Square, where mass protests became the symbol of the 2011 anti-Mubarak uprising and of hopes for democratic change in Egypt.</p>

<p>&#x201C;Take part, say &#x2026; &#x2018;yes&#x2019; for the constitutional amendments,&#x201D; says one banner near the pro-government Nation&#x2019;s Future Party. Most of the posters were apparently funded by pro-government parties, businessmen and MPs, according to reports.</p>
<p>Sisi led the 2013 military overthrow of elected president and Muslim Brotherhood member&#xA0;<a href="/news/2016/06/profile-egypt-deposed-president-mohamed-morsi-160607074148919.html">Mohamed Morsi</a>. He won his first term as president in 2014 and was re-elected in March 2018 with more than 97 percent of the vote, after standing virtually unopposed.</p>
<p>His government has been widely criticised by <a href="/topics/categories/human_rights.html">human rights</a> groups for the repression of political opponents.</p>
<p>In the past three years, more than 15,000 civilians, including children, have been referred to military prosecution in Egypt, according to Human Rights Watch.</p>
<h2>Proposed amendments</h2>
<p>The constitutional changes would only extend a president&#x2019;s term in office from four to six years and allow for a maximum of two terms.</p>
<div class="inpage-embed article-guid" data-guid="190319180632151"></div>
<p>But they also include a special article specific to Sisi that extends his current second four-year term to six years and allows him to run for another six-year term in 2024 &#x2013; potentially extending his rule until 2030.</p>
<p>Justifying this clause, Abdel-Al, the speaker, said it was aimed at &#x201C;political justice &#x2026; and the required stability.&#x201D;</p>
<p>The February draft of the special article was different, proposing to allow Sisi to run for two more six-year terms after his current term expires in 2022, possibly putting him at the helm of Egypt until 2034.</p>
<p>No reason was given for the change, apparently made by the committee that drafted the final version of the text.</p>
<p>The amendments introduce one or more vice presidents, revive the Senate and enshrine a 25 percent quota for women in parliament&#x2019;s lower, legislative chamber.</p>
<p>They allow the president to appoint top judges and bypass judiciary oversight in vetting draft legislation.</p>
<p>They declare the military the &#x201C;guardian and protector&#x201D; of the Egyptian state, democracy and the constitution, while also granting military courts wider jurisdiction in trying civilians.</p>
<p>Finally, they include provisions for what is described as adequate representation for workers, farmers, youth and people with special needs.</p>
