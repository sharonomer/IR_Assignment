<p>President <a href="/topics/people/abdel-fattah-el-sisi.html">Abdel-Fattah el-Sisi</a> has sworn in a new government, one week after the previous Cabinet resigned amid a corruption probe,&#xA0;Egypt&#x2019;s state news agency reported.</p>
<p>The new government, headed by Prime Minister Sherif Ismail, a former petroleum minister, took office on Saturday, after state-friendly media had begun slamming his predecessor Ibrahim Mehleb, and the prosecution began investigating several officials for allegedly receiving over $1 million in bribes.</p>
<p>The 33-member Cabinet contains three women and 16 new members. Two of the newcomers, Education Minister Zaki Badr and Tourism Minister Hisham Zaazou, served in similar posts under Mubarak.</p>

<hr>
<p>The country&#x2019;s interior, justice, defence, finance and investment ministers, however, kept their posts.</p>
<p>Local media had accused the ousted Prime Minister Mehleb and his ministers of incompetence and being out of touch with the public.</p>
<p>Sissi, the former general and defence minister who led the overthrow of Islamist President Mohamed Morsi in 2013, was spared the media lashing.</p>
<p>Egypt, whose governments have long been plagued by corruption allegations, has been in turmoil since the 2011 uprising that toppled longtime autocrat Hosni Mubarak.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Ismail was among the most celebrated ministers in the former Cabinet, especially after Italy&#x2019;s Eni SpA revealed late last month their discovery of the &#x201C;largest-ever&#x201D; oil field in the Mediterranean Sea off the coast of Egypt.</p>

<p>Sisi has also restructured the Cabinet, merging several ministries and forming a new body responsible for immigration, according to the Middle East News Agency.</p>
<p>Bound by the constitution, Egypt&#x2019;s new government must submit its resignation once the new parliament convenes in December, following upcoming parliamentary elections.</p>

<p>According to local media reports, the inherently short-term nature of the current Cabinet prompted some ministerial candidates to decline offers to join.</p>
<p>Egypt has been without a legislature for three years. In its absence, Sisi holds legislative authority and has passed dozens of laws by decree.</p>
<p>Also on Saturday, Sisi appointed Mehleb to the position of &#x201C;assistant to the president for national and strategic projects.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Shortly after he accepted Mehleb&#x2019;s resignation last week, Sissi said in a speech that he still &#x201C;needs Mehleb by (his) side.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Some observers have interpreted these moves as an attempt by Sisi to engineer a soft landing for Mehleb &#x2013; a former construction magnate and prominent member of Mubarak&#x2019;s now-defunct National Democratic Party.</p>
<p>&#x201C;(Sisi) is protecting Mehleb from the allegations and the talks that may follow him,&#x201D; pro-government television presenter Tamer Amin said, praising the president&#x2019;s handling of the situation.</p>
