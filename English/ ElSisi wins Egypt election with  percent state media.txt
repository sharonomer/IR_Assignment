<p><span>Abdel Fattah el-Sisi has won re-election as Egypt&#x2019;s president, according to preliminary results reported by a number of state media outlets, showing the former army general winning 92 percent of the vote.</span></p>
<p>The official MENA news agency and the state-owned newspapers al-Ahram and Akhbar el-Youm said on Thursday that 23 million out of the 60 million registered voters &#x2013; 40 percent &#x2013; turned out to cast the ballots during the three days of polling that ended on Wednesday.</p>
<p>El-Sisi&#x2019;s opposing candidate, <a href="/news/2018/03/egypt-election-mousa-mostafa-mousa-puppet-sisi-180322114130986.html">Mousa Mostafa Mousa</a>, a little-known contender who entered the presidential race hours just before the nomination deadline, received 721,000 votes, according to al-Ahram.</p>
<p>Mousa had previously endorsed Sisi for a second term, and his official Ghad party had backed Sisi&#x2019;s presidential bid just 10 days before he announced his candidacy.</p>
<p>Mousa has continuously refuted accusations that his candidacy was being used to present a false sense of competition.</p>

<p>A further two million votes were cast as invalid, as people had written the names of candidates who were not approved on their ballot papers.</p>
<p>The incumbent president received 96.0 percent of the vote in his first election in 2014, a year after <a href="/news/2016/06/profile-egypt-deposed-president-mohamed-morsi-160607074148919.html">Mohamed Morsi</a>&#xA0;of the Muslim Brotherhood, was <a href="/news/middleeast/2013/07/20137319828176718.html">overthrown as president</a> in a military coup.</p>
<p>Authorities were concerned that the turnout would be low, and there were reports that people were offered the equivalent of $3 to cast their ballots.</p>
<p>According to Al Jazeera&#x2019;s Hashem Ahelbarra, trucks were seen distributing bags of sugar, cooking oil and rice to people in poor areas.</p>
<p>&#x201C;The biggest challenge for him [el-Sisi] is the economy,&#x201D; Mohamed Elmasry, a political analyst told Al Jazeera.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Life for the average Egyptian has gotten much difficult because inflation has increased dramatically.&#x201D;</p>
<p>There are also security concerns, as Sisi has struggled to defeat groups linked to the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (<a href="/topics/organisations/isis-isil.html">ISIL</a>, also known as ISIS) in the Sinai Peninsula.</p>
