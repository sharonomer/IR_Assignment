<p>The youngest son of late Egyptian President <a href="/topics/people/mohamed-morsi.html">Mohamed Morsi</a> died of an alleged heart attack at a hospital in Cairo, sources told Al Jazeera.</p>
<p>Abdullah Morsi, who was in his mid-twenties, died on Wednesday at the Oasis hospital in Giza in the southwest of the capital, the sources said.</p>
<p>A Morsi family source confirmed his death to Anadolu Agency without giving further details.</p>
<p><a href="/topics/country/egypt.html">Egypt</a>&#x2018;s health ministry has yet to comment on his death.</p>
<p>Mohamed Morsi, Egypt&#x2019;s first democratically elected president, <a href="/news/2019/06/egypt-president-mohamed-morsi-dies-state-media-190617155322012.html">died on June 17</a> while standing trial for charges that he and legal observers said were politically motivated.</p>
<p>He was deposed in a 2013 military coup carried out by current President <a href="/topics/people/abdel-fattah-el-sisi.html">Abdel-Fattah el-Sisi</a> following a year in power.</p>
<p>Several local news sites reported the death of Abdullah Morsi, saying there was no criminal suspicion, noting that Morsi&#x2019;s son had suffered several previous health scares, and was saddened by his father&#x2019;s death.</p>
<p>Morsi&#x2019;s second son, Ahmed, said his younger brother, Abdullah, was driving his car and had sudden spasms. He was immediately taken to hospital but doctors were unable to revive him.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Abdullah died at the hospital after suffering a heart attack,&#x201D; Anadolu cited Ahmed Morsi as saying.</p>
<h2>Outspoken critic</h2>
<p>Abdullah Morsi had been imprisoned several times in recent years. He had been accused and acquitted of drug use, in a case involving allegations that he and legal observers said were fabricated.</p>
<p>Among Morsi&#x2019;s children, Abdullah was the most <a href="/news/2019/06/morsi-killed-egyptian-government-son-190621191846298.html">outspoken critic</a> of the Egyptian government. He was also the most supportive of his father and his defence during his trial and stay in prison.</p>
<p>In a Twitter post after his father&#x2019;s death, Abdullah accused a number of Egyptian officials whom he called &#x201C;partners&#x201D; of el-Sisi &#x201C;in killing the martyr president&#x201D;.</p>
<p>He particularly accused incumbent and former interior ministers Mahmoud Tawfiq and Magdy Abdel Ghaffar, respectively.</p>
<p>At the time of his death, Morsi &#x2013; a leading member of Egypt&#x2019;s Muslim Brotherhood who won the country&#x2019;s presidential election in 2012 &#x2013; faced a host of legal charges, which he, along with various human rights groups and independent observers, said were politically motivated.</p>
