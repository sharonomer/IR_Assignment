<p>Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi has called for religious reforms to counter &#x201C;extremists&#x201D; in a speech to Muslim clerics.</p>
<p>Sisi on Wednesday urged scholars from Al-Azhar, the highest centre of Sunni Muslim learning, to rethink religious discourse and &#x201C;purge it of flaws&#x201D; that negatively affect Islam.</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p>I fear that we have not until now found the real path to confronting fanaticism and extremism</p>

<p>&#x201C;I fear that we have not until now found the real path to confronting fanaticism and extremism: look at the map of extremism in the world,&#x201D; he said in the televised speech.</p>
<p>&#x201C;We are on a mission, during one of the most difficult periods not only for Egypt, but for Egypt and all Arab and Muslim states.&#x201D;&#xA0;</p>
<p>Sisi also questioned the standing of the Muslim countries on women&#x2019;s rights.</p>
<p>&#x201C;If you found that the flaw was only in Egypt, we&#x2019;d say OK. But I wonder, in how many of these 50 [Muslim] countries is this situation present?&#x201D; he asked.</p>
<p>He said early Islamic scholars confronted sayings and traditions wrongly attributed to the Muslim Prophet Muhammad. Islamic law is partly based on Muhammad&#x2019;s sayings.</p>

<p>Sisi&#x2019;s calls for reforms in Islamic thought have been met with scepticism by opponents who accuse his security services of extensive human rights abuses.</p>
<p>More than 1,000 supporters of former President Mohamed Morsi have been killed in clashes since Sisi overthrew him on July 3, 2013. More than 600 of them were killed in a single day when police dispersed a Cairo protest camp.</p>
<p>Thousands have been jailed, and critics say the crackdown has helped radicalise more people.</p>
