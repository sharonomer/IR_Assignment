<p>United States President Donald Trump has fired the head of federal agency charged with protecting the 2020 US Election from cyberattacks.</p>
<p>In a pair of tweets, Trump accused Christopher Krebs, director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, of issuing a &#x201C;highly inaccurate&#x201D; statement when he said the US election was conducted without error.</p>
<p>Krebs ran the agency, known as CISA, from its creation in the wake of Russian interference with the 2016 election through the November election.</p>
<p>He has received praise from Democrats and Republicans for his handling of the election, which generally ran smoothly despite persistent fears that foreign hackers might try to undermine the vote.</p>
<p>In recent days, Krebs has repeatedly pushed back against false claims that the election was tainted. Earlier on Tuesday, he tweeted a report citing 59 election security experts saying there is no credible evidence of computer fraud in the 2020 election outcome.</p>
<p>Trump fired back on Twitter later in the day. He repeated unsubstantiated claims about the vote and wrote: &#x201C;Effective immediately, Chris Krebs has been terminated as Director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Krebs, from his personal Twitter account, responded: &#x201C;Honored to serve. We did it right. Defend Today, Secure Tomrorow.&#x201D; He closed with the phrase &#x201C;Protect 2020,&#x201D; which had been his agency&#x2019;s slogan ahead of the election.</p>

<p>Bryan Ware, assistant director for cybersecurity at CISA, handed in his resignation on November 12. Ware did not provide details, but a US official familiar with the matter told the Reuters news agency the White House had asked for Ware&#x2019;s resignation.</p>
<p>Trump, who has yet to concede the to Biden, has repeatedly made unsubstantiated claims of electoral fraud.</p>

<p>The president, who announced troop withdrawals from Afghanistan and Iraq today, fired Defense Secretary Mark Esper on November 9 and has installed loyalists in top positions at the Pentagon.</p>
<p>Esper was replaced by Christopher Miller, who had been the director of the National Counterterrorism Center.</p>
<p>The Pentagon named Kash Patel, who was the top counterterrorism adviser on the White House National Security Council, as Miller&#x2019;s chief of staff.</p>
<p>Patel had worked as a top aide to Representative Devin Nunes, the pro-Trump&#xA0;Republican who chaired the House Intelligence Committee and now is its top minority member.</p>
<p>While working for Nunes, Patel helped produce a memo accusing the FBI and Department of Justice of bias against&#xA0;Trump.</p>
<p>The Pentagon&#x2019;s top policy adviser also resigned. The post was filled by Anthony Tata, a retired Army brigadier general who had previously called former President Barack Obama &#x201C;a terrorist leader.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Tata had failed to secure a Senate confirmation hearing in August but has been performing the duties of the deputy under-secretary of defence for policy.</p>
