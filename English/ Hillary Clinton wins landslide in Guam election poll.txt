<p>Hillary Clinton, the US <span>Democratic nominee, has</span>&#xA0;overwhelmingly won the vote in a tiny Pacific island which has correctly predicted the outcome of the <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/topics/events/election-2016.html">presidential election</a> for the last 32 years.</p>

<p>Guam, whose residents are American citizens, holds a general election poll every four years, even though it has no members in the <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/10/electoral-college-161031190257475.html">Electoral College</a>.</p>
<p><span><span><span>But while the result of Guam&#x2019;s presidential poll has no bearing on the national election, it may be an indicator of how the rest of the country will vote: Residents of the West Pacific Island, which has a population of 162 000, have correctly chosen the winner of each presidential election since 1980.&#xA0;</span></span></span></p>

<p>According to the results announced by <a href="http://www.guampdn.com/story/news/local/election-2016/2016/11/08/clinton-takes-strong-lead-straw-poll/93472300/" target="_blank">local media</a>, Clinton received 71.63 percent of the vote, while Trump received 24.16 percent.</p>
