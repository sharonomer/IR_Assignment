<p>Former Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak has been transferred from prison to house arrest at a military hospital.</p>
<p>The longtime autocrat, forced to quit in&#xA0;2011, was flown by medical helicopter from Cairo&#x2019;s Tora prison on Thursday. He&#xA0;will remain under house arrest as he stands trial on corruption and murder charges.</p>
<p>Footage on local television showed him&#xA0;transported from the helicopter to&#xA0;a hospital in the Maadi&#xA0;suburb in a heavily-guarded ambulance.</p>
<p>Mubarak spent several weeks in the same hospital during his two-year detention, after lawyers cited poor conditions in prison. Authorities renovated a ward in Tora where Mubarak was later held.</p>
<p>A small crowd of supporters gathered outside the prison and cheered as the helicopter took off.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the April 6 youth movement&#xA0;called for protests on Friday against his release.</p>
<p>But his release was&#xA0;met with indifference from many Egyptians, who are more focused on the country&#x2019;s recent political crisis and last week&#x2019;s massacre of supporters of deposed President Mohamed Morsi.</p>
<p>&#x201C;His release was widely covered, but after two years, at this time, many Egyptians see Hosni Mubarak as an irrelevance,&#x201D; Al Jazeera&#x2019;s Bernard Smith, reporting from Cairo,&#xA0;said.</p>
<p><strong>Ongoing trials</strong></p>
<p>Mubarak&#x2019;s next court hearing is scheduled for Sunday.&#xA0;He still faces a retrial on charges of killing protesters during the 2011 revolution, and three&#xA0;corruption cases as well.</p>
<p>But he has already spent more than two years in pre-trial detention, the maximum allowed under Egyptian law,&#xA0;and so the courts&#xA0;ruled him eligible for release pending trial.</p>
<p>Hazem el-Beblawi, the prime minister, said on Wednesday night that Mubarak would be placed under house arrest following his release.</p>
<p>Mubarak chose to be held at the military hospital, the official MENA news agency reported.</p>
<p>At least one of the corruption cases against Mubarak could be close to a settlement.</p>
<p>Wednesday&#x2019;s ruling ordering his release concerns the so-called &#x201C;Ahram gifts&#x201D; case, in which Mubarak allegedly accepted $11m worth of gifts, including jewelry and watches, from the state-run newspaper&#xA0;<em>Al-Ahram</em>.</p>
<p>He has allegedly already repaid the amount of the gifts, and the other defendants in the case have been released, suggesting that the charges against Mubarak could eventually be dropped.</p>
<div>He also faces charges of embezzling money from a fund earmarked for presidential palace renovations. A judge working on this case ordered him released on Monday, on the same procedural grounds. A separate charge accuses him of &#x201C;illicit gains&#x201D; during his presidency.</div>
<p>Mubarak was convicted last year of involvement in the murder of protesters during the 2011 uprising, and sentenced to life in prison, but was granted a retrial in January.</p>
<p><strong>Fresh protests due</strong></p>
<p>Egypt&#x2019;s Muslim Brotherhood and other anti-coup groups, meanwhile, have called for mass demonstrations against the military-backed interim government on Friday, as arrests of Brotherhoood leaders continued on Thursday.</p>
<p>Authorities have now detained Ahmed Aref, a spokesman for the group, and Hassan al-Brins, a member of parliament representing the Freedom and Justice Party (FJP), the political wing of the Muslim Brotherhood.</p>
<p>Supporters of the anti-coup alliance have dubbed the protest a &#x201C;Friday of martyrs&#x201D;, with 28 mosques in the Cairo area named as points of departure for the demonstrations.</p>
<p>In recent days, Brotherhood protests that once attracted tens of thousands of people at locations across the country have ebbed, suggesting the group&#x2019;s famed organisational strength may have been damaged by the arrest of its leaders. They have also been subject to a violent crackdown on the part of authorities, with at least 900 people reported killed in the last eight days, as security forces have moved to end anti-coup demonstration.</p>
<p>&#x201C;We will remain steadfast on the road to defeating the military coup,&#x201D; a pro-Morsi alliance called the National<br>Coalition to Support Legitimacy and Reject the Coup said in a statement.</p>
