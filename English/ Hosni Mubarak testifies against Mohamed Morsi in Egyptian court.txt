<p>Two former Egyptian presidents have appeared in the same Cairo courtroom with <a href="/topics/people/hosni-mubarak.html">Hosni Mubarak</a> testifying in the retrial of his successor <a href="/topics/people/mohamed-morsi.html">Mohamed Morsi</a> on mass jailbreak charges.&#xA0;</p>
<p><span>Overthrown during the 2011 protests that ended his 30-year rule, a frail, grey-haired Mubarak could be seen walking into the courtroom with a cane on Wednesday.&#xA0;</span></p>

<p>During his testimony against Morsi, Egypt&#x2019;s first democratically elected president, 90-year-old Mubarak claimed he could not answer most questions, saying he needed permission from the military and current President <a href="/news/middleeast/2013/07/201373112752442652.html">Abdel Fattah el-Sisi</a>.&#xA0;</p>

<p><span>Earlier in the month, Mubarak failed to make a court appearance in the case. His lawyer, Farid al-Deeb, had told the Cairo Criminal Court that the former president was a member of the military and that he&#xA0;</span>had to obtain permission from the military to appear in court.</p>
<p><span>Since his removal from power in a military coup staged by Sisi, Morsi has been tried in several different cases.</span></p>
<p><span>In April 2015, he was sentenced to 20 years on charges of ordering the arrest and torture of protesters in clashes outside the presidential palace in 2012.</span></p>
<p>In September 2016, Morsi was sentenced to another 25 years in prison on charges of passing intelligence to <a href="/topics/country/qatar.html">Qatar</a>. And in December 2017, he was also sentenced to three years on charges of insulting the judiciary.&#xA0;</p>
<p>After Morsi&#x2019;s 2013 removal, Sisi unleashed a fierce crackdown on his opponents, with tens of thousands jailed with charge and without in conditions condemned by <a href="/topics/categories/human_rights.html">human rights</a> groups.</p>
<p>Amnesty International has described Egypt&#x2019;s judicial system as &#x201C;<a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2015/06/egypt-confirmation-of-morsi-death-sentence-another-symptom-of-a-broken-justice-system/" target="_blank">horrendously broken</a>&#x201D; and described death sentences handed out to Morsi and other members of the <a href="/indepth/features/2017/06/muslim-brotherhood-explained-170608091709865.html">Muslim Brotherhood</a> in previous trials as a &#x201C;vengeful march to the gallows.&#x201D;</p>
<p class="speakable">In a&#xA0;<a href="https://www.detentionreview.com/drpreport/" target="_blank">report</a>&#xA0;released in March, a panel of British MPs and lawyers said Morsi&#x2019;s conditions of imprisonment had left him facing a &#x201C;premature death&#x201D;.</p>
<p class="speakable">The panel, which was commissioned by <a href="/news/2018/03/egyptian-president-morsi-facing-premature-death-180328191919233.html">Morsi&#x2019;s family</a>, said the former leader is &#x201C;receiving inadequate medical care, particularly&#xA0;inadequate management of his diabetes, and inadequate management of his liver disease&#x201D;.&#xA0;</p>
<p class="speakable">&#x201C;The consequence of this inadequate care is likely to be rapid deterioration of his long-term conditions, which is likely to lead to premature death,&#x201D; it said.&#xA0;</p>
