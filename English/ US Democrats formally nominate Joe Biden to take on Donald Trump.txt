<p>The Democrats in the United States have formally nominated Joe Biden as their presidential candidate, designating the veteran leader as their challenger to President Donald Trump in the November election.</p>
<p>In a virtual roll call vote on Tuesday, due to the coronavirus pandemic, all 50 US states and seven territories announced their tallies endorsing Biden.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Well, thank you very, very much, from the bottom of my heart,&#x201D; a beaming Biden said in a live video link as he celebrated the nomination.</p>
<p>&#x201C;It means the world to me and my family,&#x201D; he added, reminding viewers he will deliver a formal acceptance speech on Thursday at the conclusion of the four-day Democratic National Convention.</p>
<p>Biden&#x2019;s nomination was a formality as he had already won the majority of the more than 3,900 delegates back in June.</p>
<h2>Jill Biden makes the case for husband</h2>
<p>After Biden formally became a nominee, his wife, Jill Biden, addressed the nation for the first time as the prospective first lady.</p>
<p>Jill, who holds a doctorate in education, gave impassioned remarks about the closure of schools across the US&#xA0;and the loss of lives due to the pandemic.</p>
<p>She recounted her life with Joe in the aftermath of the death of his first wife and daughter in a car crash in 1972 and testified to his strength of character following his son Beau&#x2019;s death from cancer in 2018.</p>
<p>&#x201C;There are those who want to tell us that our country is hopelessly divided, that our differences are reconcilable but that is not what I see over these last few months,&#x201D; Jill said.</p>
<p>&#x201C;We just need leadership worthy or our nation and worthy of you, honest leadership to bring us back together to recover from this pandemic and prepared for whatever else is next.&#x201D;</p>
<p>After her remarks, Joe called his wife: &#x201C;The love of my life and the rock of our family.&#x201D;</p>

<h2>Ex-presidents rally for Biden</h2>
<p>The convention included presentations by Democrats, including former Presidents Jimmy Carter, 95, and Bill Clinton, 74.</p>
<p>&#x201C;At a time like this, the Oval Office should be a command centre. Instead, it&#x2019;s a storm centre. There&#x2019;s only chaos,&#x201D; Clinton said.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Just one thing never changes &#x2013; his determination to deny responsibility and shift the blame,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;The buck never stops there.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Barack Obama will speak on Wednesday along with 2016 Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton and Biden&#x2019;s running mate, Senator Kamala Harris.</p>
<h2>Russia investigation</h2>
<p>On the day the Senate Intelligence Committee released a 1,000-page report on Russia&#x2019;s interference in the 2016 election, Democrats John Kerry, the former US secretary of state, and Sally Yates, a former deputy attorney general, criticised Trump&#x2019;s unwillingness to address the issue.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Donald Trump pretends Russia didn&#x2019;t attack our elections,&#x201D; Kerry said. &#x201C;And now, he does nothing about Russia putting a bounty on our troops. So he won&#x2019;t defend our country&#x2026; The only person he&#x2019;s interested in defending is himself.&#x201D;</p>
<p>The Republican-led Senate committee report found that the FBI had ample cause to open an investigation into Trump&#x2019;s 2016 campaign.</p>

<p>The report found that former campaign manager Paul Manafort, now serving a jail term for fraud, shared sensitive Trump campaign polling data with a Russian agent and was a counterintelligence threat.</p>
<p>Yates, who served as acting US Attorney General in the early days of the Trump administration, had warned the Trump White House about contacts with Russia in 2016-2017.</p>
<p>&#x201C;From the moment President Trump took office, he has used his position to benefit himself rather than our country,&#x201D; Yates said.</p>
<p>Trump claimed Obama and Biden directed US agencies to spy on his campaign in 2016 and denied coordinating with Russia, calling the Democratic allegations a &#x201C;hoax&#x201D;.</p>
<h2>Republicans endorse Biden</h2>

<p>For a second night, the Democrats featured Republicans.</p>
<p>Colin Powell, who served as secretary of state under George W Bush and appeared at multiple Republican conventions in past years, endorsed Biden.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Our country needs a commander in chief who takes care of our troops in the same way he would his own family. For Joe Biden, that doesn&#x2019;t need teaching,&#x201D; he said.</p>
<p>Powell said he learned the same values &#x201C;growing up in the South Bronx&#x201D; that Biden did growing up in Scranton, a blue-collar city in northeastern Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>A former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the top military position in the US, Powell&#x2019;s support for Biden is likely to sway the votes of military personnel and their families concerned about national security.</p>
<p>A number of former Bush administration officials and military leaders have already formed a group to back Biden in the November election.</p>

<p>In addition to Powell, Cindy McCain, the widow of late Senator John McCain, provided her voice for a video that aired during Tuesday&#x2019;s convention featuring Biden and McCain&#x2019;s friendship.</p>
<p>The two were members of the Senate together for 20 years before Biden became Obama&#x2019;s vice president.</p>
<p>While McCain publicly supported Trump as the Republican nominee in 2016, their relationship behind the scenes was strained, with Trump being dismissive of McCain&#x2019;s record as a prisoner of war in Vietnam.</p>
<p>With the convention, the Democrats hope Biden will get a boost in opinion polls, which show him ahead of Trump by an average of 50.2 percent to 42.5 percent, according to a survey by RealClearPolitics.com.</p>
<p>Next week, the Republicans will hold their convention to officially endorse President Trump&#x2019;s bid to stay in power for another term.</p>
