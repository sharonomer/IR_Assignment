<p>Egyptian President Mohamed Morsi has told the country&#x2019;s&#xA0;senior judges that he did not infringe on their authority when he seized near absolute powers.</p>
<p>An aide to Morsi said the decree was limited to &#x201C;sovereignty-related issues,&#x201D; but that did not satisfy his critics.</p>
<p>The uncompromising stance came during&#xA0;Monday&#x2019;s meeting between Morsi and members of the Supreme Judiciary Council in a bid to resolve a four-day crisis that has plunged the country into a new round of turmoil with clashes between the two sides that have left one protester dead and hundreds wounded.</p>
<p>The judiciary, the main target of Morsi&#x2019;s edicts, also has pushed back, calling the decrees a power grab and an &#x201C;assault&#x201D; on the branch&#x2019;s independence. </p>
<p>Judges and prosecutors stayed away from many courts in Cairo and other cities on Sunday and Monday.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Muslim Brotherhood has called off a mass demonstration in Cairo, originally&#xA0;planned for Tuesday, &#x201C;until futher notice&#x201D; in order to &#x201C;avoid clashes&#x201D;.</p>

<p>Activists on Monday were camped in Cairo&#x2019;s Tahrir Square for a fourth day, blocking traffic with makeshift barricades to protest against what they said was a power-grab by Morsi. Nearby, riot police and protesters clashed intermittently.</p>
<p>Mona Amer, spokesman for the opposition movement Popular Current, said Tuesday&#x2019;s protest would go on.</p>
<p>&#x201C;We asked for the cancellation of the decree and that did not happen,&#x201D; she said.</p>
<p>Before the president&#x2019;s announcement, leftist politician Hamdeen Sabahy said protests would continue until the decree was scrapped and said Tahrir would be a model of an &#x201C;Egypt that will not accept a new dictator because it brought down the old one&#x201D;.</p>
<p><strong>Temporary measures</strong></p>
<p>Morsi&#x2019;s office repeated assurances that the measures would be temporary, and said he wanted dialogue with political groups to find &#x201C;common ground&#x201D; over what should go in Egypt&#x2019;s constitution, one of the issues at the heart of the crisis.</p>
<p>Hassan Nafaa, a professor of political science at Cairo University, saw an effort by the presidency and judiciary to resolve the crisis, but added their statements were &#x201C;vague&#x201D;.</p>
<p>&#x201C;The situation is heading towards more trouble,&#x201D; he said.</p>
<p>Sunday&#x2019;s <a class="InternalLink" href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2012/11/2012112511432479437.html">stock market fall</a> of nearly ten per cent &#x2013; halted only by automatic curbs &#x2013; was the worst since the uprising that toppled former President Hosni Mubarak in February, 2011.</p>
<p>&#x201C;We are back to square one, politically, socially,&#x201D; said Mohamed Radwan of Pharos Securities, an Egyptian brokerage firm.</p>
<p>Morsi&#x2019;s decree marks an effort to consolidate his influence after he successfully sidelined Mubarak-era generals in August, and&#xA0;reflects his suspicions of a judiciary little reformed since the fall of his predecessor.</p>
<p>Issued just a day after Morsi received glowing tributes from Washington for his work brokering a deal to end eight days of Israeli attacks on Gaza, the decree drew warnings from the West to uphold democracy.</p>
<p><strong>&#x2018;Protect the revolution&#x2019;</strong></p>
<p>The Morsi administration has defended his decree as an effort to speed up reforms that will complete Egypt&#x2019;s democratic transformation.</p>

<p>But his&#xA0;calls for dialogue have been rejected by members of the National Salvation Front, a new opposition coalition of liberals, leftists and other politicians and parties, who until Morsi&#x2019;s decree had been a fractious bunch struggling to unite.</p>
<p>The Front includes Sabahy, Nobel Peace Prize laureate Mohamed ElBaradei and former Arab League chief Amr Moussa.</p>
<p>The military has stayed out of the crisis after leading Egypt through a messy 16-month transition to a presidential election in June.</p>
<p>Analysts say Morsi neutralised the army when he sacked top generals in August, appointing a new generation who now owe their advancement to the president.</p>
<p>Though the military still wields influence through business interests and a security role, it is out of frontline politics.</p>
<p>&#x201C;There is no room for dialogue when a dictator imposes the most oppressive, abhorrent measures and then says &#x2018;let us split the difference&#x2019;,&#x201D; ElBaradei said on Saturday.</p>
<p>Morsi framed his decisions on Thursday as necessary to protect the revolution that toppled&#xA0;Mubarak nearly two years ago and to cement the nation&#x2019;s transition to democratic rule.</p>
<p>Morsi also ordered the retrial of Mubarak and top aides on charges of killing protesters during the uprising.</p>
<p>&#x201C;He had to act to save the country and protect the course of the revolution,&#x201D; Pakinam al-Sharqawi, one of Morsi&#x2019;s aides, said.</p>
<p>&#x201C;It is a major stage in the process of completing the January 25th revolution,&#x201D; she said, alluding to the starting day of last year&#x2019;s uprising against Mubarak.</p>
<p>He also created a new &#x201C;protection of the revolution&#x201D; judicial body to swiftly carry out the prosecutions.</p>
