<p>Nigeria&#x2019;s President Muhammadu Buhari plagiarised quotes from US President Barack Obama in a speech promising change in the West African country, according to a statement by his office.</p>
<p>Buhari made the address last week to launch a campaign entitled &#x201C;Change begins with me,&#x201D; part of his credo to end corruption in Africa&#x2019;s biggest economy, which is gripped by mismanagement and poverty despite sitting on vast energy reserves.</p>
<p>However, his office said on Friday that a paragraph in the speech urging Nigerians not to fall back &#x201C;on the same partisanship, pettiness and immaturity that have poisoned our country so long&#x201D; was copied from Obama&#x2019;s victory speech after his election in November 2008.</p>
<p>&#x201C;It was observed that the similarities between a paragraph in President Obama&#x2019;s 2008 victory speech and what President Buhari read in paragraph nine of the 16-paragraph address &#x2026; are too close to be passed as coincidence,&#x201D; his office said in a statement.</p>

<p>&#x201C;President Buhari urges Nigerians to look beyond this incident and focus on the message of change which the country needs in order to restore our cherished value systems,&#x201D; the office said after a Twitter user joked about the incident.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Those responsible&#x201D; would be punished, the office said, adding that a deputy director in the presidency had admitted the mistake.</p>
<p>Nigeria, which ranks 136 out of 168 countries in Transparency International&#x2019;s Corruption Perception Index for 2015, has struggled for years to fight corruption among its political elite.</p>
<p>But since Buhari was elected to power in 2014 on a campaign that vowed to root out corruption, anti-fraud agencies have arrested several senior politicians accused of embezzlement.</p>
