<p>An Egyptian court has ordered an end to&#xA0;the state of emergency, two days ahead of schedule and three months after it was imposed during a crackdown on&#xA0;protesters supporting ousted President Mohamed Morsi.</p>
<p>The cabinet said in a statement it would respect the ruling but would wait for official notification from the court before implementing it.</p>
<p>The state of emergency, accompanied by a night time curfew, had been scheduled to expire on Thursday.</p>
<p>It&#xA0;<a class="InternalLink" href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2013/08/201381413509551214.html" target="_blank">was imposed </a>after a deadly crackdown by security forces on protest camps set up by supporters of Morsi, who was overthrown by the military on July 3 following mass rallies against his rule.</p>
<p>The state of the emergency allowed the authorities to make arrests without warrants and gave security officials the right to search people&#x2019;s homes.</p>
<p>The end of the state of emergency would mean the end of the 01:00-05:00&#xA0;curfew also in&#xA0;place.</p>
<p>Al Jazeera&#x2019;s Rory Challands, in Cairo, said military officials&#xA0;there said they had not yet received an executive order to lift the curfew.</p>
<p>&#x201C;They said they have to hear something from the prime minister before they lift it,&#x201D; our correspondent said.</p>
<p><strong>Ongoing protests</strong></p>
<p>The court decision comes despite the continued protests in different parts of the country.</p>
<p>On Tuesday,&#xA0;student supporters of Morsi rallied at the university in the Nile Delta town of Mansoura. Police fired tear gas&#xA0;to disperse&#xA0;protesters, witnesses said.</p>
<p>Egypt has seen a wave of&#xA0;demonstrations and violence since the army-led overthrow of Morsi.</p>
<p>Hundreds have been killed, mostly Morsi supporters, as well as about 100&#xA0;security officers.</p>
<p>Morsi has been held in a secret location since his removal, and&#xA0;was transferred to a high-security prison in the Mediterranean port city of&#xA0;Alexandria after the opening session of his trial on November 4.</p>
<p>He has so far&#xA0;declined legal representation and&#xA0;wanted to defend himself.</p>
<p>Morsi&#x2019;s son said&#xA0;his father&#xA0;was&#xA0;meeting on Tuesday&#xA0;with a team of lawyers who sought to defend him in his ongoing trial on&#xA0;charges of inciting murder.</p>
<p>The deposed leader, who has not yet agreed to&#xA0;let the team represent him, wanted to discuss with them taking legal action&#xA0;against others, his son said.</p>
