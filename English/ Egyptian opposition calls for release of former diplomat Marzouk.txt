<p>An opposition coalition of left-leaning and secular parties in <a href="/topics/country/egypt.html">Egypt</a> has called for the immediate release of a former diplomat who was arrested after calling for a referendum on President <a href="/topics/people/abdel-fattah-el-sisi.html">Abdel Fattah el-Sisi</a>&#x2018;s government.</p>
<p>Maasoum Marzouk was <a href="/news/2018/08/egypt-diplomat-detained-call-referendum-sisi-180824060720752.html">arrested on Thursday</a> along with two others and ordered to remain in custody for 15 days pending an investigation into terror-related charges.&#xA0;</p>
<p><span>Marzouk and the other detainees &#x2013; economist Raied Salama and Yehia al-Qazzaz, a geology professor &#x2013; were accused by state-run media of cooperating with the banned&#xA0;</span><a href="/topics/organisations/muslim-brotherhood.html">Muslim Brotherhood</a><span>&#xA0;group, which Egypt&#x2019;s government designated as a &#x201C;terrorist&#x201D; group in 2013.</span></p>
<p>On Monday, the Civil Democratic Movement coalition said in a press conference that the arrests were &#x201C;part of the government crackdown to silence opposition voices&#x201D;.</p>
<p>At the press conference, Mohammed Anwar Sadat, nephew of Egypt&#x2019;s former leader <a href="/focus/2009/03/20093266460706634.html">Anwar Sadat</a>, called for &#x201C;genuine political reform&#x201D; and &#x201C;for the President and the state to listen&#x201D; to the opposition.</p>
<p>Marzouk, who was assistant minister of foreign affairs under former President <a href="/focus/2009/12/200912693048491779.html">Hosni Mubarak</a>, served in the Egyptian army&#x2019;s special forces and is a veteran of the 1973 war with Israel.</p>

<p>He is also a former Egyptian ambassador to Uganda, Finland and Estonia.</p>
<p>More recently, he helped to form the The People&#x2019;s Democratic Party and served as an adviser and spokesman for the presidential campaign of&#xA0;<a href="/news/middleeast/2014/05/profile-many-faces-hamdeen-sabahi-20145510421611445.html">Hamdeen Sabbahi</a>, a left-wing candidate who ran against Sisi in the 2014 elections.</p>
<p>Speaking at Monday&#x2019;s press conference, Sabbahi called for change, saying Sisi&#x2019;s government had failed.</p>
<p>&#x201C;We believe that this regime must be changed,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;This is a failed power. This is a repressive power &#x2026; which violated and insulted the constitution.&#x201D;</p>
<p>In a statement on August 5, Marzouk called for protests in Tahrir Square in the Egyptian capital, Cairo, saying that if his initiative was not accepted, he would hold a &#x201C;popular conference&#x201D; there.</p>
<p>The Square was the epicentre of the 2011 mass uprising that led to the downfall of Mubarak.&#xA0;</p>
<p>He had also campaigned for the release of all political prisoners, the formation of a transitional government council and a 10-year ban on political candidacy for anyone who had served in government or parliament over the past decade.</p>
<p>Sisi <a href="/news/2018/03/sisi-wins-egypt-election-92-percent-state-media-180329134411321.html">won a second four-year term</a> in April after securing more than 90 percent of the vote in a presidential election that was <a href="/news/2018/01/egyptian-opposition-calls-boycott-absurd-poll-180131064805978.html">criticised</a> as being a one-man show with no credible opposition.</p>
<p>At least six candidates were either <a href="/news/2018/02/egypt-curbs-opponents-presidential-election-180207095350993.html">jailed, prosecuted or forced to pull out of the race</a>.&#xA0;</p>
<p>Since coming to power after leading the overthrow of <a href="/topics/people/mohamed-morsi.html">Mohamed Morsi</a> in 2013, Sisi&#x2019;s government has presided over a<a href="/news/2016/05/egypt-human-rights-160510054343780.html"> sweeping crackdown on dissent</a>, jailing thousands of dissidents and journalists.</p>
<p>The government has banned unauthorised protests, heavily restricted civil society groups and blocked hundreds of websites.</p>
