<p><strong>Milan, Italy </strong>&#x2013; An Italian airline was accused of <a href="/topics/subjects/racism.html">racism</a> after a non-black actor portraying former US President <a href="/topics/people/barack-obama.html">Barack Obama </a>was heavily made up to appear as a black person.</p>
<p>Alitalia announced a non-stop flight from Rome to Washington, DC, last May.</p>
<p>The company this week created a series of marketing videos for <a href="/topics/subjects/social-media.html">social media</a> to highlight the route. Each one features four actors playing four <a href="/topics/country/united-states.html">United States</a> presidents: Abraham Lincoln, George Washington, <a href="/topics/people/donald-trump.html">Donald Trump</a> and <a href="/topics/people/barack-obama.html">Barack Obama</a>.</p>
<p>The advertising campaign, using the hashtag #WhereIsWashington, was not creating any major response until it was Obama&#x2019;s turn to find the flight to Washington. <a href="https://youtu.be/5xhj4sesylE">In the video</a>, an actor was covered in heavy black-and-brown makeup to appear African American. His nose was enlarged and his mouth and lips were changed to resemble a black man.</p>
<p>Later the airline company&#xA0;apologised for &#x201C;the offense caused by the promotional video&#x201D;.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Alitalia deeply apologises for the offense caused by the promotional video on our new Washington route. It has since been removed from all of our social media channels,&#x201D; it said in an email statement.</p>
<p>&#x201C;For our Company, respect for everyone is mandatory, it was never our intention to hurt anyone and we will learn from what has happened.&#x201D;&#xA0;</p>
<h2><span><strong>&#x2018;Humiliating&#x2019;</strong>&#xA0;</span></h2>

<p><span>Called out for&#xA0;</span><a href="/indepth/opinion/blackface-white-mask-racism-psychosis-190227094248355.html">blackface</a><span>, Alitalia initially dismissed the issue on Facebook. &#x201C;You are exaggerating,&#x201D; was the reply to an Italian user who suggested the offensiveness of the commercial.</span></p>
<p>Leonardo De Franceschi, a media and cinema researcher at the University of Rome, confronted the company on Facebook over the marketing campaign that he called &#x201C;racist&#x201D;.</p>
<p>Alitalia responded by saying, &#x201C;The actor we cast is not Caucasian, we used the makeup to change his facial features, not his skin colour.&#x201D;</p>
<p>However, the actor is not black and his skin tone appears darker after the application of foundation.&#xA0;</p>
<p>De Franceschi said the incident reflected the downplaying of racist practices in <a href="/topics/country/italy.html">Italy</a>.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Videos &#x2013; as the one produced by Alitalia &#x2013; represent a common standpoint in Italian advertising and the mainstream TV industry,&#x201D; he told Al Jazeera.</p>
<p>&#x201C;I think of popular cinepanettoni (Italian comedy movies) and of more recent films &#x2026; They reproduce stereotypes and practices &#x2013; as blackface &#x2013; that in other countries, United States and United Kingdom, for instance, wouldn&#x2019;t be tolerated.&#x201D;</p>
<p>De Franceschi said the practice should not be tolerated in Italian society.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Films like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMZ6zp-3oGY">Bamboozled</a> by Spike Lee remind us that the blackface issue isn&#x2019;t in the past,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;Sometimes in Italy, people wear blackface in anti-racist and inclusive displays, but that doesn&#x2019;t make it any less humiliating for people of African heritage.&#x201D;</p>
<h2><strong>&#x2018;Problem with ignorance&#x2019;</strong></h2>
<p>The use of blackface on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BxMzHHNFJZr/?igshid=v70qsot6cx0g" target="_blank">the Italian actor</a> of Tunisian decent to play Obama outraged many in Italy, especially Afro-Italians.</p>
<p>The African American writer Louis Pisano also criticised the Italian airline on Instagram for the ad.</p>
<p>&#x201C;I found this Alitalia video to be offensive because it is an instance of blackface and a mockery of President Obama,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;This type of humour &#x2013; which positions us as the punchline to a joke &#x2013; is damaging to the strides black people are making to combat racism.&#x201D;</p>

<p><span>Pisano said i</span>n the modern era with social media and its global reach &#x201C;this mindset only sets a country back in terms of intellectual advancement.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;I think that Italy has a huge problem with ignorance that perpetuates the cycle of racism and racist attitudes &#x2026; There is almost an unwillingness to educate themselves on historically racist practices that happened both here and abroad.&#x201D; &#xA0;</p>
<p>Pisano said what makes the video even more offensive is that it comes from a company as influential as Alitalia is in Italy. &#x201C;It becomes ingrained in the masses that this behaviour is acceptable,&#x201D; he said.</p>
