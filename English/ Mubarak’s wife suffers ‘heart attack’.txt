<p>Egypt&#x2019;s anti-graft agency has ordered former president Hosni Mubarak and his wife detained as part of a probe into charges they used their influence to amass wealth unlawfully.</p>
<p>Investigators interrogated Mubarak, who has denied wrongdoing, for more than three hours on Thursday evening in Sharm el-Sheikh, and questioned Suzanne on Friday, the state news agency MENA reported.</p>
<p>Mubarak&#x2019;s wife was later admitted to the hospital with what the facility director called a suspected heart attack.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Suzanne Mubarak has been admitted to hospital with a suspected heart attack and high blood pressure. She will be put under observation for 24 hours,&#x201D; Mohammed Abu al-Futouh told the Reuters news agency.</p>
<p>A security official said Suzanne Mubarak will remain in the hospital for the time being but was expected to be moved to a women&#x2019;s prison in Cairo.</p>
<p>As Al Jazeera&#x2019;s Rawya Rageh reported from Tahrir Square on Friday afternoon, this was the very first time the former first lady had been questioned.</p>
<p>&#x201C;This could mean that any moment now, Suzanne Mubarak could be transferred to a detention facility here in Cairo,&#x201D; she said, adding that this would probably be the Kanater Women&#x2019;s Prison.</p>
<p>&#x201C;For the past few months this prison facility has already been undergoing security preparations in preparation for a possible imminent arrival, as part of the post-revolution purge.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Once a low-key first lady known for her focus on women and children rights, she had in the last decade become known as a powerful mover in Egyptian politics.</p>
<p>She was believed to be a strong backer of her son Gamal&#x2019;s efforts to succeed his father as well as another son Alaa&#x2019;s business activities. She was known to have a say in the promotion of senior officials, and liked to be called &#x201C;Hanem,&#x201D; or &#x201C;Madam,&#x201D; as institutions and schools carrying her name mushroomed in recent years.</p>
<p>Her husband is being held in  &#x201C;preventative detention&#x201D;  in the Red Sea resort of Sharm el-Sheikh.</p>
<p>MENA said prosecutors ordered the 70-year-old Suzanne Mubarak detained for 15 days pending further investigation of the allegations.</p>
<p>The news agency said Suzanne Mubarak was asked about $3.3m held in her name in one of Cairo&#x2019;s banks as well as a luxurious home in the capital.</p>
<p>Essam al-Gohari, who heads the illicit gains authority, &#x201C;ordered the detention of former president Hosni Mubarak for 15 days following questioning in Sharm el-Sheikh that lasted three hours, over accusations of the illegal acquisition of wealth&#x201D;, MENA reported on Friday.</p>
<p>Some media reports have suggested the Mubarak family&#x2019;s wealth may total billions of dollars, a major rallying point for anti-government protests in a country where around 40 per cent of the population lives on less than $2 per day.</p>
<p>&#x201C;I expected it, yet it still feels good to hear it,&#x201D; Mohamed Ahmed, a 23-year-old banker, said in Cairo after hearing about the order.</p>
<p>Some Egyptians have been unhappy about the treatment of Mubarak, who ruled Egypt for three decades. Dozens of demonstrators gathered at a major Cairo mosque on Friday saying the deposed ruler should not be put on trial, MENA reported.</p>
<p>But others were much more positive about the calls for justice.</p>
<p>&#x201C;All of Egypt&#x2019;s people are happy with anything concerning the implementation of the law. For Suzanne to take 15 days under what is lawful; this is something that makes us happy,&#x201D; Hassan Ahmed, member of al-Tagamoa, an opposition party, said.</p>
<p>&#x201C;I am for the [the court] to investigate her, for the law to take its place and for there to be fair rulings to any wrongdoers,&#x201D; added Tarek Gohary, a doctor who was walking in downtown Cairo shortly after earlier protests in Tahrir Square that  called for national unity following Friday prayers  .</p>
