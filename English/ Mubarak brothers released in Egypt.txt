<p>The two sons of Egypt&#x2019;s overthrown leader Hosni Mubarak have been freed from prison pending a fraud retrial, according to Egypt&#x2019;s state media.</p>
<p>Alaa and Gamal Mubarak left jail early on Friday after a court ordered their release a day ago because they had served the maximum pretrial detention, the state-owned Al-Ahram newspaper reported on its website</p>
<p>Hosni Mubarak, who was removed after Egypt&#x2019;s 2011 uprising, was convicted by a lower court on corruption charges with his two sons last year, with Alaa and Gamal receiving four-year sentences.</p>
<p>Their charges included embezzling at least $16m earmarked for the maintenance of presidential palaces.</p>
<p>The retrial of the former leader and his two sons was ordered this month and their lawyer Farid al-Deeb said at the time that the elder Mubarak, who is in a military hospital, would also be a free man.</p>
<p>However, state media reported there had been no orders yet for his release and there have been no signs of the 86-year-old leaving the hospital.</p>
<p><strong>Stock market manipulation</strong></p>
<p>Ahram reported that Alaa, 54, and Gamal, 51, were transported from jail to a police station in northern Cairo before being freed.&#xA0;They are both facing a separate trial for stock market manipulation.</p>
<p>In the last decade of Mubarak&#x2019;s 30-year rule, Gamal in particular was seen as the likely successor of his father and headed the powerful policies committee of the now dissolved National Democratic Party.</p>
<p>The release of the Mubaraks presents a dilemma for President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, a former army chief whom opponents accuse of reviving Mubarak-era practices.</p>
<p>His prime minister, Ibrahim Mahlab, was a senior member of the National Democratic Party.</p>
<p>Sisi took power after overthrowing Egypt&#x2019;s first post-revolution leader &#x2013; the Muslim Brotherhood-backed president Mohamed Morsi &#x2013; in 2013 and won an election with massive support last year.</p>
<p>However, he has faced accusations of being even more authoritarian than Mubarak, unleashing a crackdown on Morsi supporters that has killed at least 1,400 people.</p>
