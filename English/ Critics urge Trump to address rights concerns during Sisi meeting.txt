<p>Egyptian President <a href="/topics/people/abdel-fattah-el-sisi.html">Abdel Fattah el-Sisi</a>&#xA0;is set to meet US President <a href="/topics/people/donald-trump.html">Donald Trump</a> on Tuesday amid continued controversy at home over his bid to extend his rule and&#xA0;concerns over human rights violations.</p>
<p>The meeting will be Sisi&#x2019;s second visit to the White House since he took office in 2014.</p>
<p>Relations between Cairo and Washington were tense under Trump&#x2019;s predecessor, Barack Obama. But they have warmed considerably under Trump, who has been willing to set aside human rights concerns to rebuild close defence and diplomatic ties.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, the two heads of state will discuss military, economic, and counterterrorism cooperation, according to a White House statement.</p>
<p>&#x201C;The two leaders will also discuss developments and shared priorities in the region, including enhancing regional economic integration and addressing ongoing conflicts, and Egypt&#x2019;s longstanding role as a lynchpin of regional stability,&#x201D; a White House statement said.</p>
<p>Rights groups accuse Egypt of instituting a widespread crackdown on dissent, including the torture of political prisoners &#x2013; allegations the Egyptian government has denied.&#xA0;</p>
<p>Rights concerns are not expected to top Tuesday&#x2019;s agenda, and groups accuse the US of overlooking abuses by Egypt.&#xA0;</p>
<p>In<span>&#xA0;2018, the Trump administration released $195m in military<span>&#xA0;aid to Egypt after withholding the assistance the previous year over human rights concerns. The US said&#xA0;<span>the decision followed steps Egypt took in response to specific US concerns, and it cited stronger US-Egypt ties in security and counterterrorism while also acknowledging remaining areas of concern about human rights and governance.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>The Trump administration has asked Congress for $1.382bn in assistance for Egypt for the next fiscal year.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p>Earlier this year, Mike&#xA0;<a href="/news/middleeast/2019/01/cairo-pompeo-delivers-trump-vision-confrontation-iran-190110140303307.html">Pompeo, the US secretary of state, delivered a speech</a>at the American University in Cairo where he outlined Trump&#x2019;s Middle East vision.&#xA0;</p>

<p>During his visit, Pompeo praised Sisi as a partner in the fight against &#x201C;terrorism&#x201D; while dodging questions over rising human rights concerns under Sisi.</p>
<p>Critics have urged the White House to address human rights concerns during Sisi&#x2019;s visit to the US, as well as the Egyptian president&#x2019;s attempt to hold onto power.&#xA0;&#xA0;</p>
<h2>&#x2018;Power grab&#x2019;</h2>
<p>In February, Egypt&#x2019;s parliament approved a set of proposed constitutional amendments that would allow Sisi to rule up until 2034 and give the military greater power. The amendments are expected to be put to a referendum later this month.&#xA0;</p>
<p>&#x201C;The fact that the trip is happening right now is directly tied to Sisi&#x2019;s desire for the US and Trump&#x2019;s endorsement for [his] attempt to change the constitution to allow him to stay in power and bolster his power in other ways,&#x201D; said Amy Hawthorne, research director at the Project on Middle East Democracy (Pomed).</p>
<p>Human Rights Watch (HRW) said on Tuesday that the amendments, which would also increase the military&#x2019;s political role and grant Sisi control over the judiciary, would &#x201C;institutionalise authoritarianism&#x201D;.&#xA0;</p>
<p>US officials have not publicly criticised efforts by the Egyptian parliament or Sisi&#x2019;s supporters to advance amendments to the constitution, and some see Sisi&#x2019;s White House visit as a way for the Egyptian president to secure the green light for the amendments.&#xA0;&#xA0;</p>

<p><span>&#x201C;Sisi is in Washington to obtain a green light for proposed constitutional amendments that grant the military highly abusive powers and further institutionalise authoritarianism,&#x201D; said Michael Page, HRW&#x2019;s&#xA0;</span><span>deputy Middle East and Northern Africa director. </span></p>
<p><span>&#x201C;Given President Trump&#x2019;s silence on abuses, Congress should step up and condemn this initiative,&#x201D; he added.&#xA0;</span></p>
<p><span>Magdelina Mughrabi, the deputy Middle East and North Africa director at Amnesty International, added that the amendments would &#x201C;</span>worsen the devastating human rights crisis Egyptians are already facing&#x201D;.&#xA0;</p>
<p>On Monday, a bipartisan group of leading US senators called on the State Department to raise key concerns in meetings with Sisi.</p>
<p>In a letter to Secretary of State Pompeo, 17 senators urged him to convey concerns over the detention of American citizens by the Egyptian government, Egypt&#x2019;s deepening relationship with the Kremlin including the reported purchase of Russian fighter jets, and the concerning erosion of political and worsening human rights in recent years.</p>
