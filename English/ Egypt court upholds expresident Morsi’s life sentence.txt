<p>An Egyptian court has upheld a life sentence&#xA0;for overthrown Islamist President <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/topics/people/mohamed-morsi.html">Mohamed Morsi</a> on charges of harming national security by leaking secret state documents to <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/qatar.html">Qatar</a> while he was in office.&#xA0;</p>
<p>Morsi, democratically elected after Egypt&#x2019;s 2011 revolution, was removed from his position in mid-2013 by a coup led by <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/topics/people/abdel-fattah-el-sisi.html">Abdel Fattah al-Sisi</a>, the army chief of the time.</p>
<p>Morsi was immediately arrested after the coup and Sisi has been the president of the country since 2013.</p>

<p>The court also confirmed death sentences against three defendants in <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/05/egypt-sentences-death-espionage-case-160507101207579.html">the same case</a>. </p>
<p>There have been no explanations yet for the rulings and they cannot be appealed.</p>
<p>In 2014, <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/egypt.html">Egypt</a> charged Morsi and nine others with endangering national security by leaking state secrets and sensitive documents to Qatar.</p>
<h2><span>Sisi&#x2019;s crackdown</span></h2>
<p>Morsi is already serving a 20-year sentence after being convicted for the killing of protesters during demonstrations in 2012.</p>
<p>Since toppling Morsi, Sisi has clamped down on dissent. Mass trials have been held for thousands of supporters of <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/topics/organisations/muslim-brotherhood.html">Muslim Brotherhood</a>, which Morsi was a member of, and hundreds have received death sentences or lengthy prison terms.</p>
<p>Cairo&#x2019;s relations with Doha were already troubled by Qatar&#x2019;s backing of Morsi during the time of the crisis.</p>
<p>Egypt is one of four Arab nations in a Saudi-led bloc that cut relations with the Gulf state on June 5, accusing it of backing &#x201C;extremist&#x201D; groups and cooperating with their regional rival <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/iran.html">Iran</a>, allegations Doha has repeatedly denied.</p>
