<p>At least two people have been killed in the latest anti-governement protests in Egypt.</p>
<p>Violence erupted in the province of Fayoum, south of the capital Cairo, after supporters of ousted President Mohamed Morsi staged rallies following Friday prayers. A teenage boy was killed, medical and security sources said.</p>
<p>There were conflicting reports of whether he was killed in clashes with police or between residents and protesters. Health Ministry official Medhat Shukri said three policemen were also&#xA0;wounded in the violence.</p>
<p>Another person was killed when protesters clashed with government supporters in the Ain Shams district, northeast of the capital,&#xA0;a Cairo&#xA0;police official said.</p>
<p>Security officials said that 13 protesters were arrested, including five in Fayoum, who were found in possession of petrol bombs.</p>
<p><span style="font-size:13px">Protests against the government have been held since the army overthrew Morsi last July following mass protests against his rule .</span></p>
<p>Demonstrations have been staged in his support. However they lost strength after a fierce security crackdown against his Muslim Brotherhood party.</p>
<p>At least 1,400 people have been killed, while more than 15,000 others have been jailed and hundreds sentenced to death.</p>
<p><strong>&#x2018;War without end&#x2019;</strong></p>
<p>Meanwhile, the government says anti-state violence has killed more than 500 people, mostly police and soldiers in the last year.</p>
<p>On Friday, security sources said one civilian was killed and one wounded when gunmen opened fire on an army checkpoint near the Suez Canal city of Ismailia.</p>
<p>The latest attack on the army came hours before a self-declared jihadist group operating in the country threatened to escalate its assaults on military targets.</p>
<p>The Sinai-based Ansar Beit al-Maqdis [Partisans of Jerusalem], the most&#xA0;active armed &#xA0;group in Egypt, said it was engaged in a &#x201C;war without end&#x201D;.</p>
<p>&#x201C;We will continue to fight the army until the day of judgement,&#x201D; said a recording posted on Twitter by the group that has pledged allegiance to al-Qaeda.</p>
<p>The latest threat comes two weeks after a suicide bomber in a vehicle blasted a security checkpoint in the north of the Sinai Peninsula, killing 30 soldiers.</p>
<p>However, no group has yet admitted responsibility for the deadliest attack on the military since Morsi&#x2019;s overthrow.</p>
