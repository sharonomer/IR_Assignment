<p>He was 87. </p>
<p>El-Shafie, born in the Nile Delta city of Tanta in 1918, died on Friday morning at his home after a long illness, his nephew Nadia el-Shafie told The Associated Press. </p>
<p>El-Shafie was an officer in the Egyptian military during the 1948 war between the Arabs and Israel, and like many returned disillusioned with Egypt&#x2019;s King Farouq after the Arabs&#x2019; losses. </p>
<p>He joined Gamal Abdel Nasser in the Free Officers Movement, a group of military officers who toppled the king in 1952. Abdel Nasser, who became president, elevated el-Shafie to war minister in 1954. He led the court that tried members of the Muslim Brotherhood after an alleged assassination attempt against Abdel Nasser that same year. </p>

<p>Abdel Nasser&#x2019;s successor Anwar al-Sadat named el-Shafie vice-president in 1970 but removed him five years later after el-Shafie opposed Sadat&#x2019;s policies towards Israel. </p>
<p>El-Shafie sharply opposed al-Sadat&#x2019;s 1979 peace deal with Israel. </p>
<p>Al-Sadat replaced el-Shafie as vice-president with Hosni Mubarak, who rose to the presidency after al-Sadat&#x2019;s assassination in 1981. </p>
<p>El-Shafie&#x2019;s funeral will be on Saturday.</p>
