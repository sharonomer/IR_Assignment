<p>Donald Trump has said he will leave the White House if the Electoral College certifies Joe Biden as the winner of the November 3 presidential election, the closest the United States president has come to conceding the contest.</p>
<p>After a Thanksgiving videoconference with members of the US military on Thursday, Trump was asked if he would leave the White House if Biden, the US president-elect, officially wins the Electoral College vote.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Certainly, I will. Certainly, I will. And you know that,&#x201D; Trump replied.</p>
<p>Major news agencies called the race for Biden earlier this month, saying the former US vice president had secured 306 <a href="/news/2020/10/15/us-election-explainer-the-electoral-college">Electoral College votes</a> compared with Trump&#x2019;s 232.</p>
<p>A candidate must gain 270 electoral votes to win the presidency.</p>
<p>Electoral College voters, known as electors, are scheduled to meet on December 14. Electors mostly vote based on the outcome of the presidential race in their states.</p>

<p>He offered no concrete evidence of widespread voting irregularities.</p>
<p>Trump also said officials in key states that he lost were &#x201C;communists&#x201D; and &#x201C;enemies of the state&#x201D;.</p>
<p>He declined to say whether he would attend Biden&#x2019;s inauguration, scheduled for January 20, but said he intends to hold a rally in the US state of Georgia on December 5 in support of two Republican Senate candidates there.</p>
<p>The result of those election runoffs will decide which party gets a majority in the US Senate.</p>
<p>The Trump campaign has refused to recognise Biden as the outright winner of the presidential race, filing lawsuits in several key states and stymying Biden&#x2019;s transition efforts.</p>
<p>Most of the Trump campaign challenges focused on allegations of voter fraud and have <a href="/news/2020/11/24/where-things-stand-with-trump-and-the-election">been dismissed by courts</a>. Michigan&#x2019;s certification of its results on Tuesday appeared to seal Trump&#x2019;s losing fate.</p>
<p>On November 6, Biden campaign spokesman Andrew Bates hinted that Trump could be removed should he refuse to leave office, <a href="/news/2020/11/6/trespassers-escorted-out-biden-campaign-hints-trump-removal">saying</a> the US government &#x201C;is perfectly capable of escorting trespassers out of the White House&#x201D;.</p>
