<p>Egypt&#x2019;s President <a href="/topics/people/abdel-fattah-el-sisi.html">Abdel Fattah el-Sisi</a> has played down a call for protests against his rule, saying there were &#x201C;no reasons for concern&#x201D; even as the army and the police tightened security in the capital, Cairo, and other major cities.</p>
<p>The dismissal on Friday came as rights groups said nearly 2,000 people have so far been arrested in a broad crackdown following last week&#x2019;s small but rare demonstrations against el-Sisi, who took power in a 2013 coup.</p>
<p>&#x201C;There are no reasons for concern. <a href="/topics/country/egypt.html">Egypt</a> is a strong country thanks to Egyptians,&#x201D; the president told reporters with a smile, shortly after his return from the <a href="/topics/organisations/un.html">United Nations</a> General Assembly (<a href="/news/2019/09/hold-general-assembly-2019-latest-updates-190916224113531.html">UNGA</a>) in New York.</p>
<p>In Cairo, security forces closed off entrances to Tahrir Square, the hub of the 2011 uprising that toppled former leader <a href="/topics/people/hosni-mubarak.html">Hosni Mubarak</a>. There was a heavy police presence around the square and at some junctions in the city centre.</p>
<p><span>Egypt&#x2019;s Ministry of Interior, in a brief statement on Thursday, warned it would &#x201C;confront any attempt to destabilise social peace in a firm and decisive way&#x201D;. </span></p>
<p>Last week&#x2019;s protests were in response to a call for action from <a href="/news/2019/09/mohamed-ali-man-calling-el-sisi-removal-190921014032765.html">Mohamed Ali</a>, an Egyptian businessman who accused el-Sisi of wasting public funds on vanity projects despite widespread poverty. The former military contractor, who lives in self-imposed exile in <a href="/topics/country/spain.html">Spain</a>, has called for a &#x201C;million-man march&#x201D; and a &#x201C;people&#x2019;s revolution&#x201D; to topple el-Sisi.</p>

<p><span>In a new video posted on Thursday night, Ali urged protesters not to clash with security forces and said Tahrir Square must not be the focus of the &#x201C;Friday of Salvation&#x201D; protests. &#x201C;All the squares in Egypt are Tahrir Squares,&#x201D; he said.</span></p>
<p>El-Sisi, who came to power after leading the military overthrow of then-President <a href="/topics/people/mohamed-morsi.html">Mohamed Morsi</a> in 2013, has rejected Ali&#x2019;s allegations. He has overseen a broad crackdown on dissent that has extended to liberal as well as Islamist groups and has&#xA0;effectively banned protests.</p>
<p>Morsi, the country&#x2019;s first democratically-elected president, died in June. He had been in custody since he was deposed as the president.</p>
<p><a href="/topics/organisations/human-rights-watch.html">Human Rights Watch</a> said on Friday that nearly 2,000 people had been arrested over the past week, in what could be the biggest crackdown since 2013.</p>
<p><span>&#x201C;Lawyers for detainees have posted on their social media pages several accounts of security forces arbitrarily arresting many people merely for being in the &#x2018;wrong place at the wrong time&#x2019; or possessing critical content on their phones,&#x201D; the rights group said.&#xA0;&#xA0; </span></p>
<p><span>In the first official acknowledgement of the protests, the attorney general&#x2019;s office said &#x201C;not more than 1,000 protesters&#x201D; had been questioned by prosecutors. Detainees included a Dutch national and a Palestinian belonging to the Islamic Jihad group, they said.</span></p>
<p><span>It said prosecutors had orders to &#x201C;inspect the social media accounts and pages of those detained&#x201D;.</span></p>
<p><span>The Egyptian Center for Economic and Social Rights said 96 minors were among the 1,915 people who have been arrested between last weekend and early on Wednesday. </span></p>
<p><span>Eight human rights groups issued a statement demanding the immediate release of political activists and the lifting of restrictions on freedom of expression.</span></p>
<p><span>&#x201C;The protests also are a reaction to the president&#x2019;s accumulated policies since his assumption of office, which have achieved neither political nor economic stability,&#x201D; the statement read.</span></p>
<p><span>Meanwhile, state-run local media have launched a campaign to discredit protesters as traitors who seek to instigate chaos. </span></p>
<p><span>The president&#x2019;s backers have also called for a counterdemonstration with pro-Sisi television ONE telling supporters to gather at the Hisham Barakat Square in Cairo &#x201C;to show them the love Egyptians have for their country and their leader&#x201D;.</span></p>
