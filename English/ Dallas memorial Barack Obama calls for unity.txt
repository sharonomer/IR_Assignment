<p>US President Barack Obama has implored Americans of all races to show more unity and understanding as he addressed an emotional memorial ceremony for <a class="internallink" href="http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/inpictures/2016/07/images-dallas-devastating-night-160709023649133.html" target="_blank">five police officers shot dead in Dallas</a> last week.</p>
<p>&#x201C;I know that Americans are struggling right now with what we&#x2019;ve witnessed over the past week,&#x201D; Obama said on Tuesday</p>
<p>&#x201C;I&#x2019;m here to say we must reject such despair. I&#x2019;m here to insist that we are not as divided as we seem.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Obama&#x2019;s speech included a frank admission that his own efforts to tackle violence, guns and racism had come up short.</p>
<p>&#x201C;I have spoken at too many memorials during the course of this presidency,&#x201D; he said with uncommon candour. &#x201C;I&#x2019;ve seen how a spirit of unity born of tragedy can gradually dissipate.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;I&#x2019;ve seen how inadequate words can be in bringing about lasting change. I&#x2019;ve seen how inadequate my own words have been.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Al Jazeera&#x2019;s Patty Culhane, reporting from in Dallas, said that unlike Obama&#x2019;s previous speeches after other mass shootings, &#x201C;this was not a president hoping to comfort people, just the opposite.</p>
<p>&#x201C;This was an impatient president,&#x201D; Culhane said.</p>
<p><span>Obama said it was time for the country to start having &#x201C;uncomfortable conversations about race&#x201D;, as well as&#xA0;</span>inequality and gun control, Culhane added.</p>

<p>Micah Johnson, 25, a US military veteran, was killed on July 7 by police using an explosive device after he shot dead five police officer in the streets of Dallas following a<a class="internallink" href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/07/lives-matter-thousands-protest-cities-160710053522795.html" target="_blank"> demonstration over police killings of African-Americans.</a> Nine other officers and two civilians were wounded by Johnson.</p>
<p>Black Americans protesting about police racism, Obama said, must understand how hard the police&#x2019;s job can be.</p>
<p>&#x201C;You know how dangerous some of the communities where these police officers serve are. And you pretend as if there&#x2019;s no context?&#x201D;</p>
<p>Obama also challenged a mostly-white police force and white Americans at large to admit that while the edifice of legalised racism had gone,<a class="internallink" href="http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2016/07/structural-racism-won-diminish-time-160711065351686.html" target="_blank"> prejudice remained.</a></p>
<p>&#x201C;We have all seen this bigotry in our own lives at some point,&#x201D; he said.</p>
<p>&#x201C;We&#x2019;ve heard it at times in our own homes. If we&#x2019;re honest, perhaps we&#x2019;ve heard prejudice in our own heads and felt it in our own hearts.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Obama also made a call for Republicans to realise the cost of their opposition to gun control and spending on mental health and drug treatment.</p>
<p>&#x201C;We allow poverty to fester so that entire neighbourhoods offer no prospect for gainful employment,&#x201D; Obama said, pointing to a string of causes for violence.</p>
<p>&#x201C;We refuse to fund drug treatment and mental health programmes. We flood communities with so many guns that it is easier for a teenager to buy a Glock than get his hands on a computer or even a book.&#x201D;</p>
<p><span>Following the service, Obama spent more than an hour with families of the officers killed and wounded.</span></p>
