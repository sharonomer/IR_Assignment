<p>Barack Obama, the Democratic presidential candidate, said he wanted a running mate who would be prepared to step in as president, could help him govern and would challenge him.</p>
<p>In Joe Biden,&#xA0;a 35-year veteran of the Senate,&#xA0;Obama has chosen a Washington insider with extensive experience and a reputation for&#xA0;speaking his mind.&#xA0;</p>
<p>The chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Biden has met many world leaders and&#xA0;is one of the most influential foreign policy voices in the US Congress.</p>
<p>An internationalist and strong supporter of the United Nations, he has been a leading critic of what he sees as the vague, unilateralist approach of George Bush, the incumbent president.</p>
<p>Recently he travelled to the Georgian capital Tbilisi, at the invitation of Mikheil Saakashvili, the president, and criticised Russia&#x2019;s conduct in the conflict over the breakaway region of South Ossetia.</p>
<h2>Iraq critic</h2>
<p>In 2002, Biden voted to authorise the US-led invasion of Iraq, which Obama opposed from the start, but&#xA0;has since become a firm critic of the&#xA0;war.</p>
<p>Last year, he&#xA0;pushed through a resolution declaring that Bush&#x2019;s so-called troop surge &#x2013; which has been hailed as a success &#x2013; was &#x201C;not in the national interest&#x201D;. He also won praise for a peace plan which would have divided the country along ethnic lines.</p>
<p>Biden also has a personal interest in the conflict, his son Beau, Delaware&#x2019;s district attorney and a national guard reservist, is due to leave for Iraq at the beginning of October.</p>
<p>&#x201C;I don&#x2019;t want him going,&#x201D; he told the crowd at a state fair crowd in Iowa. &#x201C;But I don&#x2019;t want my grandsons or granddaughters going back in 15 years. So how we leave makes a big difference.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Many see Biden as the ideal candidate for the traditional role of the vice-presidential candidate, attacking the other party&#x2019;s man, given his love&#xA0;of joining the debates on the US&#x2019;s political talk shows.</p>
<p>But&#xA0;his&#xA0;outspoken style has proved a hindrance on occasions,&#xA0;as he has become notorious for&#xA0;his long-winded answers.</p>
<p>However, in a debate last year, he countered a question on whether he had the self-discipline to cut down on his trademark style, simply saying: &#x201C;Yes&#x201D;.</p>
<h2>Senate experience</h2>
<p>A lifelong politician, 65-year-old&#xA0;Biden outdoes even John McCain, Obama&#x2019;s Republican rival, in terms of Senate experience, having served five years more than the Arizona senator.</p>

<p>But&#xA0;there are echoes of Obama&#x2019;s youthful idealism in his past. He was one of the youngest politicians ever elected to the Senate and entered the race for the Democratic nomination in 1988 promising to &#x201C;rekindle the fire of idealism in our society&#x201D;.</p>
<p>He&#xA0;was&#xA0;reluctantly forced to quit that race three months later after he was caught plagiarising lines from a speech given by Neil Kinnock, the then leader of Britain&#x2019;s opposition&#xA0;Labour party.&#xA0;&#xA0;</p>
<p>His latest bid for the White House was short-lived, pulling out of the race after getting less than 1 percent in the first nominating conquest in Iowa.</p>
<p>The event highlighted something which could become an issue on the campaign trail as a vice-presidential candidate, his propensity for gaffs.</p>
<p>Biden told the New York Observer newspaper: &#x201C;I mean, you got the first mainstream African American who is articulate, and bright and clean and a nice-looking guy.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Some took the remark to remark to be racially offensive, however, Obama said he was not offended and the matter was dropped.</p>
<p>He was also forced to defend his remark that &#x201C;you cannot go to a 7-Eleven or a Dunkin&#x2019; Donuts unless you have a slight Indian accent&#x201D;.</p>
<h2>Car accident</h2>
<p>Biden has suffered his fair share of&#xA0;difficulties,&#xA0;both personal and political,&#xA0;during his 35 years in the Senate. Just weeks after his election in 1972, his first&#xA0;wife Neilia and&#xA0;13-month-old daughter Naomi were killed in a car accident. His sons Beau and Hunt were badly hurt.</p>
<p>He was sworn in at the hospital bedside&#xA0;of one of his sons and still refuses to work on December 18, the day of the accident.</p>
<p>He remarried 15 years later, having a daughter with his new wife Jill Tracy Jacobs.&#xA0;&#xA0;</p>
<p>The senator&#xA0;himself had a brush with death in February 1988 when he was hospitalised with two brain aneurysms. It was seven months before he could return to the Senate.</p>
<p>Born in 1942,&#xA0;the Roman Catholic son of a Pennsylvania car salesman, Biden could help Obama connect with blue-collar Democrats who the campaign has so far struggled to attract.</p>
<p>He is seen as more down-to-earth than many Senate colleagues commuting by train from Delaware to Washington, DC, every day rather than taking a home in the capital.</p>
