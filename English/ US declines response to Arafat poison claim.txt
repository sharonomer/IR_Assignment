<p>Hillary Clinton, the US secretary of state, has&#xA0;said Washington&#xA0;will wait for the results of any new investigation into Yasser Arafat&#x2019;s death and will not be responding to &#x201C;rumours&#x201D;.</p>
<p>Speaking in Vietnam on Tuesday, Clinton said she would visit Israel next week to discuss a broad range of issues with Israeli leaders, including Middle East peace efforts.</p>
<p>Her arrival in the region comes as Mahmoud Abbas, the leader of the Palestinian Authority,&#xA0;has approved exhuming remains of the late Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and wants an international probe of his predecessor&#x2019;s mysterious 2004 death.</p>
<p>Clinton said speculation will not help the process.</p>
<p>A nine-month <a class="internallink" href="http://www.aljazeera.com/programmes/whatkilledarafat/" target="_blank">investigation by Al Jazeera</a> revealed earlier this month that Arafat was in good health until he fell ill abruptly and died in October 2004.</p>
<p><strong>Radioactive element</strong></p>
<p>The report cited tests that revealed that Arafat&#x2019;s final personal belongings &#x2013; his clothes, his toothbrush, even his iconic kaffiyeh &#x2013; contained abnormal levels of polonium, a rare, highly radioactive element.</p>
<p>Those personal effects, which were analysed at the Institut de Radiophysique in Lausanne, Switzerland, were variously stained with Arafat&#x2019;s blood, sweat, saliva and urine.</p>
<p>The tests carried out on those samples suggested that there was a high level of polonium inside his body when he died.</p>
<p>&#x201C;I can confirm to you that we measured an unexplained, elevated amount of unsupported polonium-210 in the belongings of Mr Arafat that contained stains of biological fluids,&#x201D; Dr Francois Bochud, the director of the institute, said.</p>
<p>The findings have led <a class="internallink" href="http://www.aljazeera.com/programmes/whatkilledarafat/2012/07/20127383653774794.html" target="_blank">Suha Arafat</a>, the widow of the former Palestinian leader, to ask the Palestinian Authority to exhume her late husband&#x2019;s body from its grave in Ramallah.</p>
<p><strong>&#x2018;Helping them&#x2019;</strong></p>
<p>If tests show that Arafat&#x2019;s bones contain high levels of polonium, it would be more conclusive proof that he was poisoned, doctors say.</p>
<p>&#x201C;I know the Palestinian Authority has been trying to discover what Yasser died from,&#x201D; <a class="internallink" href="http://www.aljazeera.com/programmes/whatkilledarafat/2012/07/20127375720962440.html" target="_blank">Suha Arafat said in an interview</a>. &#x201C;And now we are helping them. We have very substantial, very important results.&#x201D;</p>
<p>The institute studied Arafat&#x2019;s personal effects, which his widow provided to Al Jazeera, the first time they had been examined by a laboratory.</p>
<p>Doctors did not find any traces of common heavy metals or conventional poisons, so they turned their attention to more obscure elements, including polonium.</p>
