<p>Egyptian President Mohamed Morsi has defied calls to curb his sweeping powers and refused to call off a referendum on a disputed constitution that has&#xA0;led to&#xA0;the country&#x2019;s worst political crisis in two years.</p>
<p>Addressing the nation on Thursday night, he&#xA0;called for dialogue and offered sympathy for recent&#xA0;deaths of&#xA0;protesters, but&#xA0; offered&#xA0;few concessions and dismissed his political opposition.</p>
<p>His speech&#xA0;prompted immediate angry reactions from protesters in Cairo&#x2019;s Tahrir Square and elsewhere, who yelled &#x201C;Leave!&#x201D; and chanted other anti-Morsi slogans.</p>
<p>Morsi&#xA0;proposed a meeting on Saturday with political leaders, &#x201C;revolutionary youth&#x201D; and legal figures to discuss the way forward, but a leading activist group rejected the offer, and fresh demonstrations were called for Friday.</p>
<p>The &#x201C;April 6&#x201D; movement, which played a prominent role in igniting the revolt against former President Hosni Mubarak, said on its Facebook page that Friday&#x2019;s protests would deliver a &#x201C;red card&#x201D; to Morsi.</p>
<p>The&#xA0;deepening political crisis began after Morsi issued a decree on November 22 granting him wide-ranging powers which are not subject to judicial review.</p>
<p>Protests reached a peak on Wednesday, and&#xA0;seven&#xA0;people were killed overnight&#xA0;and more than 770 were injured <a class="internallink" href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2012/12/201212584345620395.html">during hours of clashes</a> outside the presidential palace.&#xA0;Supporters of the president attacked a group of opposition protesters staging a peaceful sit-in, using firebombs, clubs and guns, according to witnesses.</p>
<p>In his speech, Morsi called the violence &#x201C;regrettable&#x201D;, and blamed it on &#x201C;infiltrators&#x201D; funded by unnamed third parties.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Such painful events happened because of political differences that should be resolved through dialogue,&#x201D; he said.</p>
<p>&#x201C;I call for a full, productive dialogue with all figures and heads of parties, revolutionary youth and senior legal figures to meet this Saturday.&#x201D;</p>
<p><strong>Brotherhood offices ablaze</strong></p>
<p>As&#xA0;Morsi was wrapping up his speech, protesters stormed the Cairo villa housing the headquarters of the Muslim Brotherhood which backed him in the June presidential election.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Two hundred thugs went to the headquarters. Security tried to prevent them, but some got through the back door, ransacked it and set it on fire,&#x201D; Mahmud Ghozlan, a&#xA0;spokesperson for the group,&#xA0;said.</p>
<p>The unrest has turned into the worst political crisis of Morsi&#x2019;s five-month-old tenure. Protesters have camped out for days outside his palace, and in Cairo&#x2019;s Tahrir Square.</p>
<p>The army on Thursday ordered the square in front of the presidential palace cleared of protesters from both sides, deploying tanks and setting up barbed wire.</p>
<p>&#x201C;I hope that Mr Morsi will realise that the situation is very bad &#x2026; Support for the opposition [is ] increasing &#x2026; and the nation itself is in danger&#x201D; Abdullah al-Ashaal, a professor of international law at the American University in Cairo and a critic of the president, told Al Jazeera.</p>
<p>Opposition leaders have called on Morsi to delay a constitutional referendum planned for December 15, and to revoke his decree.&#xA0;Morsi did say he &#x201C;would not insist&#x201D; on keeping the most controversial provision, article 6, which shields his decisions from review.</p>
<p>But he said the referendum would proceed as planned, so that &#x201C;people can have their say&#x201D;.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Let them vote yes or no,&#x201D; Morsi said.</p>
<p>He&#xA0;said he would supervise the formation of a new constituent assembly if the draft is rejected.</p>
<p>Critics say the 100-member panel that drafted the document was <a class="internallink" href="http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2012/10/20121019620186523.html">dominated by Islamists and unrepresentative</a> of Egyptian society. Nearly two dozen members, including liberals and representatives of the Coptic Church, have resigned over the last few weeks.</p>
<p>Despite the opposition, though, the draft is widely expected to be approved. It has the support of the Muslim Brotherhood, by far the best-organised political force in Egypt, and several other Islamist factions.</p>
<p><strong>Leading opponents</strong></p>
<p>Leading opposition figures, including Mohamed ElBaradei, Hamdeen Sabbahi and Amr Moussa, blamed Morsi for Wednesday&#x2019;s&#xA0;deaths, which many witnesses said&#xA0;occurred after protesters loyal to the president charged the opposition.</p>
<p>Morsi has insisted that the violence is being&#xA0;caused by a minority of protesters who receive &#x201C;black money&#x201D; and weapons from unnamed parties.</p>
<p>&#x201C;They took advantage of the situation,&#x201D; he said, without elaborating.</p>
<p>Senior officials from the Muslim Brotherhood have spent the last two weeks insisting that members of&#xA0;Mubarak&#x2019;s regime are trying to overthrow Morsi &#x2013; though none have been able to describe any specific plots.</p>
<p>Seven of Morsi&#x2019;s senior advisers have resigned in the past two weeks, including four since Wednesday&#x2019;s violence.</p>
<p>For his part, US President Barack Obama expressed &#x201C;deep concern&#x201D; on Thursday over the events in Egypt, in a call to his counterpart Morsi, the White House said in a statement.</p>
<p>Obama told Morsi that it was &#x201C;essential for Egyptian leaders across the political spectrum to put aside their differences and come together to agree on a path that will move Egypt forward&#x201D;, according to the statement.</p>
