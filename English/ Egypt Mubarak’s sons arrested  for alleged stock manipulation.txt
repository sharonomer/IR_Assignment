<p>An Egyptian court has ordered the arrest of two sons of former President <a href="/topics/people/hosni-mubarak.html">Hosni Mubarak</a> over stock market manipulation, according to state media.</p>

<p>Gamal, the younger of the two, was once considered his father&#x2019;s heir apparent.&#xA0;</p>
<p>Alaa was not involved in politics, but has faced allegations of having amassed a fortune through his father&#x2019;s contacts.</p>
<p><span>He confirmed his detention in a post on Twitter, voicing hope that &#x201C;the truth will be revealed one day&#x201D;.</span></p>
<p>Hosni Mubarak ruled <a href="/topics/country/egypt.html">Egypt</a> from 1981 until he was overthrown in a <a href="/programmes/rewind/2018/04/cloneofseeds-change-revisiting-egypt-april-6-act-180406164917804.html">2011 uprising</a>, which went on to become part of the <a href="/topics/subjects/arab-spring.html">Arab Spring</a>. Since then, Mubarak and his sons have spent several spells in detention.</p>
<p>The trio was previously <a href="/news/2015/05/150509102401084.html">sentenced to three years in prison</a>&#xA0;following corruption convictions in 2015 for diverting more than $11.5m in public money to maintain presidential palaces.</p>
<p>The sons were freed five months later, while Mubarak <a href="/news/2017/03/hosni-mubarak-walks-free-years-jail-170324095324330.html">was released in March 2017</a>after he was cleared of inciting the killing protesters. He remains under investigation for alleged <a href="/topics/issues/corruption.html">corruption</a>.</p>
<p>Three other men were also arrested on Saturday, including Yasser el-Mallawany and Hassan Heikal, current and former board members at the Egyptian investment bank EFG-Hermes, a judicial source told the Reuters news agency.</p>
<p>All those accused in the case, which began in 2012, had previously been released on bail and barred from travel.&#xA0;</p>
