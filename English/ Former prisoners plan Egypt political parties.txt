<p>Abboud al-Zommor, the mastermind behind the 1981 assassination of Egypt&#x2019;s former president Anwar Sadat, has been released after spending decades in prison.</p>
<p>He was the leader of Jihad, a group trying to overthrow the secular government and establish an Islamic state.</p>
<p>Now, after the ouster of former president Hosni Mubarak&#x2019;s government, al-Zommor plans to take part in mapping out the future of Egypt.</p>
<p>Islamic groups do have support in Egypt even though they were banned and suppressed under Mubarak&#x2019;s government. But some fear that when these groups&#xA0;are allowed&#xA0;the right to form legal parties, they could&#xA0;become a strong force and change the face of the country.</p>
