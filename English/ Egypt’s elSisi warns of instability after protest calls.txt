<p>Egypt&#x2019;s President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi has warned against attempts to stoke instability in the country following a recent spate of scattered and small-scale anti-government demonstrations.</p>
<p>The protests come amid mounting anger, particularly in rural and low-income areas, against sweeping government campaigns to stop illegal construction, which have required people to pay fines to legalise home-ownership. During his speech on Sunday, el-Sisi thanked Egyptians for not heeding the calls, saying the government was undertaking the measures as part of reforms.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Some people have been trying in recent weeks to take advantage of the tough measures we are taking,&#x201D; el-Sisi said at a ceremony to inaugurate an oil refining complex north of Cairo.</p>
<p>&#x201C;They choose the hard conditions to harm and cast doubts among Egyptians over what we do.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Dozens of people took part in rare protests in recent days in several villages in Egypt, according to a video shared widely on social media, especially by sympathisers of the Muslim Brotherhood, an outlawed group.</p>
<p>Exiled businessman Mohamed Ali, who has been urging anti-el-Sisi protests since last year, has intensified his calls in recent weeks in online videos, calling on Egyptians to take to the streets against the government.</p>
<h2>Protesters killed, arrested</h2>
<p>On Saturday, family and medical sources said a man was killed in clashes between protesters and police in a village south of Cairo.</p>

<p>Prominent rights lawyers also reported on Facebook the arrest of more than 150 people in the demonstrations.</p>
<p>On Sunday, Egypt&#x2019;s public prosecutor said it ordered the release of 68 minors who took part in the demonstrations.</p>
<p>&#x201C;The minors&#x2019;&#xA0; parents committed to maintaining the safety and security of their children, promising that they would ensure the minors do not return to such acts of destruction in the future,&#x201D; said the prosecutor in a statement circulated on social media.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Meanwhile, we continue to investigate in the cases of the other detainees,&#x201D; it added.</p>
<p>Protests have been effectively banned in Egypt since 2013.</p>
<p>A renewable state of emergency has been in place since 2017, a measure that rights groups say has allowed the government to crush dissent.</p>
