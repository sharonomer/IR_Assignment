<p>The job of the US president comes with the title &#x201C;commander-in-chief&#x201D;. Many regard that as the most important role.</p>
<p>On Wednesday night, on board a former aircraft carrier which is now a museum, we saw the first joint forum of the US presidential election campaign.</p>
<p>And suitably for the venue, it concentrated on foreign policy and military matters.</p>

<p>There was not to be a head-to-head. That confrontation between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump will come in the first presidential debate later this month.</p>
<p>Instead, the candidates followed each other on to the stage, with 30 minutes allocated to cover important global questions.</p>
<p>It wasn&#x2019;t nearly enough.</p>

<p>First up was Clinton. The Democrat faced questions about her use of a private e-mail server, her support for the war in Iraq and the allegations from her opponent that her policies while secretary of state have left the Middle East in a mess.</p>
<p>If she had hoped the e-mail scandal would have blown itself out by now, she was wrong. And she&#x2019;ll have to sharpen her answers before the first debate.</p>
<p>In fact, she spent so long answering questions on the e-mail scandal that when she tried to address the details of the Iran nuclear deal, she was hurried by the moderator.</p>
<p>She also made the bizarre statement that &#x201C;no Americans died&#x201D; in the turmoil in Libya.</p>
<p>Four Americans died in an attack on the US consulate in Benghazi four years ago this week, an event which still casts a long shadow over her time at the state department.</p>
<h2>Iraq War support</h2>
<p>Clinton also acknowledged that her support for the war in Iraq &#x2013; she was serving the Senate at the time &#x2013; was &#x201C;a mistake&#x201D;.</p>
<p>Trump, Clinton&#x2019;s Republican rival, sent social media ablaze when it came to the war in Iraq.</p>
<p>He insisted he had opposed it from the very beginning &#x2013; he didn&#x2019;t.</p>
<p>In fact, he gave a radio interview where he expressed, albeit lukewarmly, support for an impending invasion.</p>
<p>And even though numerous fact-check organisations have pointed this out, he continues to insist his judgment on the issue was impeccable.</p>
<p>https://twitter.com/moneyries/status/773953221077250048</p>
<p>Trump insisted his business experience had prepared him to be commander-in-chief because he&#x2019;d done deals all over the world.</p>
<p>When asked about links to Russia, the Republican candidate insisted that Vladimir Putin was a better leader than US President Barack Obama and that, &#x201C;if he says great things about me, I&#x2019;m going to say great things about him&#x201D;.</p>
<p>Throughout the campaign, Trump has insisted he had a secret plan to beat ISIL and that he knew more about the armed group than the generals. That message has changed just in the past few days.</p>

<p>Now he will ask the generals to take the first 30 days he&#x2019;s in office to draw up a comprehensive plan to defeat ISIL &#x2013; even though he suggested he might demand new generals as he&#x2019;s unimpressed by the record of the current incumbents.</p>

<p>Trump now receives intelligence briefings. And he insisted that Obama is not following what he&#x2019;s being told by the experts.</p>
<p>Given that the briefers do not give policy advice but simply lay out the facts, Trump said he divined the problem because, &#x201C;I&#x2019;m pretty good with body language, I could tell they were not happy.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Predictably, both sides left the USS Intrepid claiming they had won the evening.</p>
<p>What it did show is that the candidates have a lot of homework to do before the first presidential debate.</p>
<p>That will draw huge audiences, will be 90 minutes with no breaks, and a lot less forgiving.</p>
<p>The tension between the two candidates was palpable and they weren&#x2019;t even on stage together.</p>
<p>The stakes couldn&#x2019;t be higher on September 26, for the campaigns &#x2013; and the country.</p>
