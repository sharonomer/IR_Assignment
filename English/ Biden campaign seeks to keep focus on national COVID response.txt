<p>With President Donald Trump <a href="/news/2020/10/4/trump-doctors-say-he-is-improving-was-given-steroid-dexamethason">undergoing treatment</a> for COVID-19 at a military hospital, Democratic challenger Joe Biden&#x2019;s campaign is looking to keep its focus on the nation&#x2019;s response to the pandemic in the final month before the presidential election.</p>
<p>Former Vice President Biden, who tested negative on Friday, three days after <a href="/news/2020/9/30/trump-biden-clash-over-virus-the-economy-in-first-debate">debating with Trump</a>, has repeatedly wished the president a speedy recovery.</p>
<p>But Biden and his aides have used the president&#x2019;s positive test to underline a consistent campaign message: Biden would handle the pandemic better than Trump.</p>
<p>Deputy campaign manager Kate Bedingfield on Sunday said Biden would continue to make the case for the remaining 30 days of the campaign that he has &#x201C;the steady hand to get this country through this crisis&#x201D;.</p>
<p>&#x201C;It&#x2019;s a choice between two different styles of leadership and since the virus came to our shores back in the spring, Joe Biden has led by example,&#x201D; she told ABC, citing the campaign&#x2019;s use of masks, social distancing and limits on the number of people at campaign events. &#x201C;I think that that&#x2019;s what the American people are looking for.&#x201D;</p>

Trump briefly had an opportunity to pivot the public&#x2019;s focus away from COVID-19 when the death last month of Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg gave him the chance to name a third lifetime appointment to the top court before his own illness returned the spotlight to the disease.<p></p>
<p>Biden is expected on Monday to campaign in Florida, where polls show a tight race to win the state&#x2019;s crucial 29 electoral college votes.</p>
<p>Voting is already well under way &#x2013; more than 3.3 million ballots had been cast nationwide by Sunday, according to the Elections Project at the University of Florida &#x2013; as more Americans vote early or by mail to avoid being exposed to the virus at crowded polling places on Election Day, November 3.</p>
<p>A Reuters/Ipsos poll taken on October 2-3, after the president tested positive for the coronavirus, found Biden leading Trump by 10 percentage points nationally and nearly two-thirds of Americans thought Trump probably would not have been infected if he had taken the virus more seriously.</p>
<p>Biden&#x2019;s campaign has pulled TV and online advertisements attacking Trump, which Bedingfield said reflected the candidate&#x2019;s belief in &#x201C;civility&#x201D;.</p>

<p>It remains uncertain when Trump will return to the campaign trail, if at all, and whether he will be able to participate in the second presidential debate on October 15.</p>
