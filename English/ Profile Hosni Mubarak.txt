<p>Hosni Mubarak, Egypt&#x2019;s&#xA0;third and longest-serving president,&#xA0;stepped down on February 11, 2011, after an  18-day-long mass uprising  aimed at removing him from power.</p>
<p>Omar Suleiman, the country&#x2019;s then newly appointed vice-president,  announced the move in a brief statement  &#xA0;on state television, hours after Mubarak was reported to have left the capital Cairo for the Red Sea resort city of Sharm El-Sheikh.</p>
<p>Mubarak&#x2019;s resignation followed mass protests in Egypt against his 30-year rule, and came  a day after he surprised the people of his country  by refusing to resign.</p>
<p>The former president succeeded&#xA0;Anwar Sadat, who was assassinated on October 6, 1981 while attending a military parade to commemorate the 1973 Arab-Israeli war.</p>
<p>Born in 1928 in Munofiya governorate in the Nile River delta, Mubarak exhibited a leaning toward the military. A graduate of the Air Force academy, he would serve as its director between 1966 and 1969.</p>
<p>In 1972,&#xA0;Sadat appointed him as Air Force commander; he would later receive accolades from the late president over the Egyptian Air Force&#x2019;s accomplishments during the conflict with Israel.</p>

<p>Talaat Sadat, the late president&#x2019;s nephew and current member of parliament, alleged that Mubarak was about to be dismissed from his post a few days before Sadat&#x2019;s assassination.</p>
<p>In 2006, marking the 25th anniversary of his uncle&#x2019;s death, Sadat accused unnamed generals in the Egyptian military of masterminding the assassination plot.</p>
<p>The military strongly denied the allegations and a military court sentenced Sadat to one year in prison for defaming the national army.</p>

<p>In 1975, Sadat appointed Mubarak to the post of&#xA0;vice-president and gave him his first taste of mainstream politics as a senior member of the ruling National Democratic Party (NDP).</p>
<p>It was not clear why Sadat chose Mubarak, although some believe it was&#xA0;in reward for Mubarak&#x2019;s effective tenure as&#xA0;chief of the&#xA0;air force.</p>
<p><strong> Egypt&#x2019;s isolation&#xA0; </strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong> When Mubarak assumed power, Egypt was isolated from Arab and Muslim countries, many of whom had broken off diplomatic ties&#xA0;after Sadat signed a&#xA0;peace treaty with Israel in 1979.</p>
<p>In one of its greatest diplomatic defeats,&#xA0;Egypt was kicked out of the Arab League and its headquarters were moved from Cairo to Tunisia.</p>
<p>Mubarak&#x2019;s first foreign policy mandate was to bring his country back into the Arab fold and to resume ties with major players in the region.</p>
<p>His first success was in&#xA0;building a relationship with&#xA0;the then influential Arab leader Saddam Hussein, the Iraqi president, whose country was locked in a bloody war with Iran.</p>
<p>Egypt signed on as Iraq&#x2019;s ally in the conflict, providing military assistance and expertise to Baghdad.</p>
<p>By the time the Iran-Iraq war ended in 1988, Egypt had successfully emerged from its isolation. In 1990, in a move spearheaded by Iraq and Yemen, the Arab League headquarters were returned to Cairo.</p>
<p>But the Arab rapprochement was short-lived as Egypt opposed Iraq&#x2019;s invasion of Kuwait in August 1990. Mubarak urged Saddam to withdraw his forces from Kuwait; when Baghdad failed to do so, Egypt joined the US-led international effort to drive Iraqi troops out of Kuwait.</p>
<p><strong> Economic growth </strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong> Egypt&#x2019;s military and logistical role in the US-led coalition during the&#xA0;first Gulf War earned it Washington&#x2019;s favour, which in turn pressured G8 countries to write off much of Cairo&#x2019;s foreign debt.</p>
<p>The 1990s saw an increase in US financial aid to Egypt and revived US-Egyptian strategic talks. The talks resulted in a strategic alliance between the two countries and the implementation of the US-Egypt Science and Technology Cooperation Agreement.</p>
<p>The agreement was vital for Egypt, which is known to have considerable&#xA0;high-calibre manpower, but suffers enduring financial problems.</p>
<p>One of the main objectives of the US-Egyptian alliance was a commitment to the peace process in the Middle East. Throughout the 1990s,&#xA0;Egypt became the main peace broker between the Israelis and Arabs, including the&#xA0;Palestinians.</p>
<p>In 1994, Jordan followed Egypt&#x2019;s diplomatic route and signed a peace treaty with Israel.</p>
<p>In successive years, the Egyptian resort of Sharm El Sheikh, which lies on the southern tip of the Sinai Peninsula &#x2013; an area seized by Israel in 1967 but returned&#xA0;in the 1980s as part of the peace treaty &#x2013; hosted several peace summits.</p>
<p>Arab press metaphorically nicknamed the resort the Arabian Camp David.</p>
<p>In 2008, Mubarak managed to draw up a lull between Hamas and Israel. Mubarak&#x2019;s government is also currently playing a major role in Hamas-Fatah talks in Cairo for Palestinian national reconciliation.&#xA0;</p>

<p>While Mubarak&#x2019;s foreign policies long dominated the Middle East,  his domestic record was not nearly as successful.</p>
<p>Mubarak refused to lift a martial law decree, in force since Sadat&#x2019;s assassination, which allowed security forces to detain civilians without warrants and to try them in military courts.</p>
<p>Opposition groups say the decree has allowed the government to crack down on political expression.</p>
<p>In June 1995, Mubarak survived an assassination attempt on his motorcade while he was attending an Organisation of African Unity Summit in Ethiopia.</p>
<p>Egyptian authorities accused al-Gama&#x2019;a al-Islamiyya, a violent group which had targeted Egyptians and tourists in previous attacks in Egypt in a bid to overthrow the government, of orchestrating the attack.</p>
<p>Shortly after Mubarak&#x2019;s return to Cairo, the authorities cracked down on Islamist groups, imprisoning hundreds and leading human rights organisations to accuse the government of human rights violations.</p>
<p><strong>Political reforms</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>In February 2005, Mubarak called on parliament to amend Article 76 of the constitution to&#xA0;allow multiple candidates to run in elections scheduled for later that year.</p>
<p>However, opposition groups said the reforms imposed new restrictions on independent presidential candidates that were not fielded by the ruling NDP.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, elections were held in September 2005, and for the first time, Egyptians were able to vote for multiple candidates. Mubarak won the elections with 88 per cent of the vote.</p>
<p>Since his win,&#xA0;opposition and civil rights organisations have accused Mubarak of planning to pass the presidency on to his youngest son Gamal, who was appointed in 2002 as secretary-general of the NDP&#x2019;s policy committee.</p>
<p>The Muslim Brotherhood, an Islamist movement founded in 1928,&#xA0;is considered one of the most effective and popular opposition groups in Egypt and is perhaps Mubarak&#x2019;s greatest anathema.</p>
<p>Banned as a political party, the Brotherhood have persistently called for political reforms and voiced strong opposition to Mubarak&#x2019;s continuing presidency. Hundreds of its members, including senior leaders, have routinely been&#xA0;arrested.</p>
<p><strong>Poverty and corruption&#xA0;</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>Under Mubarak&#x2019;s liberal economic policies, business in Egypt&#xA0;experienced an unprecedented boom&#xA0;in the past few years, most notably in the real estate sector.</p>

<p>However, Egypt is still plagued by rampant unemployment, with millions living in poverty.</p>
<p>The dichotomy of classes in Egypt had exacerbated criticism that Mubarak, and his son Gamal,&#xA0;favoured a group of businessmen within the NDP.</p>
<p>Opposition groups said the NDP&#x2019;s business cartel used their authority to monopolise the country&#x2019;s wealth, while most of the Egyptian people are living in despair.</p>
<p>The NDP has denied these accusations repeatedly and stressed that the party is open&#xA0;to all Egyptians.</p>
<p>Egyptian opposition groups also blamed Mubarak&#x2019;s government for not doing enough to fight corruption. According to the corruption perceptions index compiled by Global Coalition Against Corruption, Egypt ranked 105&#xA0;in the list of least corrupted countries in 2006, tied with Burkina&#xA0;Faso and Djibouti,&#xA0;and 115 in 2008. Finland was seen as the least corrupt nation in the world.</p>
<p>Mubarak&#xA0;was also accused by opposition groups of failing to fulfil the promise he made during his 2005 election campaign to increase job opportunities.</p>
<p>This accusation&#xA0;was denied by the NDP&#x2019;s economic committee which claimed that the government managed to reduce the number of unemployed Egyptians from 2.5 million in 2003 to 1.9 in 2008.</p>
<p><strong>Media freedoms?</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>Mubarak also came under severe criticism for cracking down on the local press.</p>
<p>Despite some progress &#x2013;&#xA0;the&#xA0;press, theatre and cinema have become bolder in touching&#xA0;on issues once considered taboo, including serious criticism&#xA0;of the government and ruling party &#x2013; critiquing the president is still considered a red line.</p>
<p>In September 2007, several opposition journalists and editors were arrested for &#x201C;harming the public interest&#x201D; by publishing articles which a judge said implied that the NDP was dictatorial.</p>
<p>Mohammed Sherdy, the deputy editor of <em> Al-Wafd </em> newspaper, told Al Jazeera in 2007&#xA0;that the sentencing stands as a message to writers and journalists in Egypt that they are not allowed to exercise their right to criticise the government.</p>
<p>Ibrahim Eissa, the editor of the opposition newspaper <em> al-Dustour </em> , <em> </em> was arrested in March 2008 and imprisoned in September for publishing reports suggesting that the president was ill. Eissa&#x2019;s arrest cast doubts&#xA0;over just how free the Egyptian press really is.</p>
<p>Although pardoned by Mubarak, Eissa&#xA0;went on to criticise&#xA0;the lack of press freedom in his country.</p>
<p>&#x201C;This verdict isn&#x2019;t just about freedom of the press and freedom in this country. This proves that anything concerning the president is a sacred and untouchable matter,&#x201D; he said.</p>
<p>&#x201C;In this country, it&#x2019;s normal for journalists to be jailed while businessmen are freed,&#x201D; he said in reference to an acquittal in August of five defendants over a 2006 ferry sinking in which more than 1,000 people died.</p>
<p>Speculation had&#xA0;run high&#xA0;over whether Mubarak&#xA0;would nominate himself for the next presidential elections in 2011 or whether he would leave&#xA0;the scene for his son Gamal.</p>
<p>But Mubarak announced on February 1 in a televised address that he would not run for re-election.</p>
<p>However, he also used that address to say he would not step down from office &#x2013; a central demand of the  hundreds of thousands of protesters  who had taken to the streets, and&#xA0;a demand&#xA0;that was eventually&#xA0;heeded&#xA0;10 days later.</p>
