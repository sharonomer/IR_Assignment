<p>Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi has approved amendments to the country&#x2019;s state of emergency that grant him and security agencies additional powers, which the government says are needed to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus.</p>
<p>The changes on Saturday were condemned by a prominent rights group, which said Cairo has used the public health crisis to &#x201C;expand, not reform, Egypt&#x2019;s abusive Emergency Law&#x201D;.</p>
<p>The new amendments allow the president to take measures to contain the virus, such as suspending classes at schools and universities and quarantining those returning from abroad.</p>
<p>But they also include expanded powers to ban public and private meetings, protests, celebrations and other forms of assembly.</p>
<p>The government has waged an unprecedented crackdown on dissent since 2013, when el-Sisi led a military coup that deposed his democratically-elected&#xA0;predecessor, President&#xA0;<a href="/news/2016/06/profile-egypt-deposed-president-mohamed-morsi-160607074148919.html">Mohamed Morsi</a>, of the now-outlawed&#xA0;<a href="/indepth/features/2017/06/muslim-brotherhood-explained-170608091709865.html">Muslim Brotherhood</a>&#xA0;movement.</p>
<p>The amendments also allow military prosecutors to investigate incidents when army officers are tasked with law enforcement or when the president orders it.</p>
<p>The country&#x2019;s chief civilian prosecutor would have the final say on whether to bring matters to trial.&#xA0;</p>
<p>The amended law would also allow the president to postpone taxes and utility payments as well as provide economic support for affected sectors.</p>
<p>Parliament, which is packed with el-Sisi supporters, approved the measure last month.</p>

<p><span>Unauthorised protests have been banned for years in&#xA0;</span>Egypt, which has been under a state of emergency since April 2017. The government extended it late last month for another three months.</p>
<p>The law was originally passed to give the president broader powers for counterterror measures and fighting drug trafficking.</p>
<p>The government said the amendments were needed to address a legal &#x201C;vacuum&#x201D; revealed by the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>Egypt, with a population of 100 million, has reported nearly 8,500 confirmed coronavirus cases and a<span>t least 503 related deaths.</span></p>
<h2>&#x2018;Repressive powers&#x2019;</h2>
<p>However, only five of the 18 amendments are clearly related to public health, and the new powers can be used whenever a state of emergency is declared, according to&#xA0;Human Rights Watch (HRW).</p>
<p>&#x201C;Some of these measures could be needed in public health emergencies, but they should not be open to abuse as part of an unreformed emergency law,&#x201D; said Joe Stork, the New York-based rights group&#x2019;s Middle East and North Africa director.&#xA0;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Resorting to &#x2018;national security and public order&#x2019; as a justification reflects the security mentality that governs Sisi&#x2019;s Egypt.&#x201D;</p>
<p>In response to the pandemic, Egypt has halted international air travel and shuttered schools, universities, mosques, churches and archaeological sites, including the famed Giza pyramids.</p>
<p>A curfew is in place from 9am till 6pm local time. The partial lockdown is to continue for another two weeks, until the end of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan.</p>
