<p>Since January 25, the Egyptian popular protest movement has continued to grow. With violent clashes in Cairo&#x2019;s Tahrir Square threatening to embroil thousands more from the pro- and anti-government camps, the world awaits one man&#x2019;s decision.</p>
<p>Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak spoke to his countrymen on February 1, just hours after&#xA0;a &#x201C;million-man march&#x201D;, and swore that he would not abdicate his throne, as the Tunisian president had done just weeks before.</p>
<p>While Mubarak did promise that he would not run in the elections to be held later in 2011, most protesters were not satisfied that the 30-year president had met their simple demand &#x2013; that he resign.</p>
<p>The new vice-president, Omar Suleiman, said on Thursday that the government is willing to hold talks with the Muslim Brotherhood. Yet Suleiman warned that continued calls for Mubarak&#x2019;s immediate departure would cause chaos in Egypt.</p>
<p>Anti-regime groups are calling for Friday to be Mubarak&#x2019;s &#x201C;day of departure&#x201D; and speculation abounds that new protests could rival last Friday&#x2019;s, which erupted soon after midday prayers.</p>
