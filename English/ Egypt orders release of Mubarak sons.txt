<p>An Egyptian court has ordered the release of the sons of ousted President Hosni Mubarak pending their retrial in a corruption case, their lawyer told the Reuters news agency.</p>
<p>Farid el-Deeb said on Thursday this meant that Alaa and Gamal Mubarak should be released because they were not being tried in any other cases.</p>
<p><span>Mubarak&#x2019;s eldest son, Alaa, was a businessman, while his youngest son, Gamal,&#xA0;</span>was a senior official in the ruling party and widely tipped to succeed his father before popular protests brought down the regime in 2011.</p>
<p>The brothers have been held in detention since April 2011, two months after their father resigned in the face of a popular uprising.</p>
<p>Mubarak was sentenced to life in prison for involvement in the deaths of hundreds of people during the 18-day uprising. He was acquitted and is now facing a retrial.</p>
