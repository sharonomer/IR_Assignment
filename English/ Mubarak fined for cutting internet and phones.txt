<p>An Egyptian court has&#xA0;fined ousted president Hosni Mubarak and former officials&#xA0;more than&#xA0;$90m for cutting off access to internet and mobile phone services during the country&#x2019;s massive protests in January.</p>
<p>A court source told the Reuters news agency on Saturday that Mubarak&#x2019;s fine is $34m, former interior minister Habib al-Adly will owe $53m, and former prime minister Ahmed Nazif has a fine of $7m.</p>
<p>The amounts relate to compensation for lost revenue as a result of the decision to cut off access for five days starting on January 28, said the source.</p>
<p>The fine is to be paid from personal assets, and the state has the right to increase the amount over the year if damages continue to rise.</p>
<p>This was the first court ruling against Mubarak since he was ousted on February 11.</p>
<p>Mubarak faces far more serious charges, including ordering the killing of protesters, a charge which could carry the death penalty.</p>
