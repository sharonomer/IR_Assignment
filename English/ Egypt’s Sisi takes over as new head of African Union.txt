<p><strong>Addis Ababa, Ethiopia </strong>&#x2013; Egypt&#x2019;s President <a href="/news/middleeast/2013/07/201373112752442652.html">Abdel Fattah el-Sisi</a>&#xA0;took over as chair of the African Union&#xA0;(<a href="/topics/organisations/african-union.html">AU</a>) following a meeting by heads of state from the continent in Ethiopia&#x2019;s capital on Sunday.</p>
<p><span>The post rotates annually between the five regions of the continent.</span></p>
<p>The Egyptian leader is expected to focus on the fight against armed groups on the continent and rebuilding efforts of countries recovering from conflict.</p>
<p><span>&#x201C;Terrorism remains a cancer that affects African nations and steals the dreams of our people and we must identify and combat those who fund terrorism activities on the continent,&#x201D; Sisi said in a speech to the AU assembly shortly after his appointment.</span></p>
<p>Under <a href="/topics/country/egypt.html">Egypt</a>&#x2018;s leadership the bloc will prioritise mediation and &#x201C;preventive diplomacy&#x201D; as one of the key mechanisms for promoting peace and security on the continent, <span>he added</span>.</p>
<p>Sisi takes the helm from Rwandan President <a href="/topics/people/paul-kagame.html">Paul Kagame</a>, who focused on creating an <a href="/topics/regions/africa.html">Africa</a>&#xA0;wide free-trade zone during his tenure.</p>

<p>&#x201C;There is no doubt that you (Sisi) will take our union forward decisively to new and greater heights,&#x201D; the Rwandan leader said as he handed over to Egypt&#x2019;s president.</p>
<p><span>In recent years, Cairo has had a frosty relationship with the African Union.</span></p>
<p><span>Egypt was kicked out of the 55-member state pan-African body in 2013 following a Sisi-led military coup.&#xA0;</span></p>
<p>The coup resulted in the overthrew of the country&#x2019;s democratically elected leader, <a href="/news/2016/06/profile-egypt-deposed-president-mohamed-morsi-160607074148919.html">Mohamed Morsi</a>, and brought Sisi to power.&#xA0;<span>The bloc later lifted Egypt&#x2019;s suspension.</span></p>
<h2><strong>&#x2018;Shocking contempt&#x2019;</strong></h2>
<p>Meanwhile, Amnesty International expressed concern that Sisi&#x2019;s leadership of the bloc could harm the continent&#x2019;s <a href="/topics/categories/human_rights.html">human rights</a> record.</p>

<p><span>&#x201C;During his time in power, President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi has demonstrated a shocking contempt for human rights. Under his leadership the country has undergone a catastrophic decline in rights and freedoms,&#x201D; said Najia Bounaim, Amnesty&#x2019;s North Africa campaign director.</span></p>
<p><span>&#x201C;There are real fears about the potential impact his chairmanship could have on the independence of regional human rights mechanisms and their future engagement with civil society,&#x201D; Bounaim added.</span></p>
<p><span>It is the first time since the AU was founded in 2002 that Egypt assumes the top seat of the body.<br> </span></p>
