<p style="line-height:150%"><span style="font-family:inherit;line-height:150%">&#x201C;The line between politics and activism is very blurred in this country,&#x201D; said David Linfield, spokesman for the US Embassy in Cairo.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%"><span style="font-family:inherit;line-height:150%">Others said the United States cannot be held responsible for activities by groups it doesn&#x2019;t control. </span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%"><span style="font-family:inherit;line-height:150%">&#x201C;It&#x2019;s a very hot and dynamic political scene,&#x201D; said Michelle Dunne, an expert at the Atlantic Council think-tank. Her husband, Michael Dunne, was given a five-year jail sentence in absentia by a Cairo court for his role in political funding in Egypt. </span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%"><span style="font-family:inherit;line-height:150%">&#x201C;Just because you give someone some money, you cannot take away their freedom or the position they want to take,&#x201D; said Dunne. </span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%"><span style="font-family:inherit;line-height:150%">Elliot Abrams, a former official in the administration of George W. Bush and a member of the Working Group on Egypt that includes Dunne, denied in an<span style="background:none repeat scroll 0% 0% white"> email message that </span>the US has paid politicians in Egypt, or elsewhere in the Middle East.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%"><span style="background:none repeat scroll 0% 0% white;font-family:inherit;line-height:150%">&#x201C;The US does not provide funding for parties or &#x2018;local politicians&#x2019; in Egypt or anywhere else,&#x201D; said Abrams. &#x201C;That is prohibited by law and the law is scrupulously obeyed by all US agencies, under careful Congressional oversight.&#x201D; </span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%"><span style="font-family:inherit;line-height:150%">But a State Department official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the issue&#x2019;s sensitivity, said American support for foreign political activists was in line with American principles. </span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%"><span style="font-family:inherit;line-height:150%">&#x201C;The US government provides support to civil society, democracy and human rights activists around the world, in line with our long-held values, such as respecting the fundamental human rights of free speech, peaceful assembly, and human dignity,&#x201D; the official wrote in an email. &#x201C;US outreach in Egypt is consistent with these principles.&#x201D;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%"><span style="font-family:inherit;line-height:150%">A Cairo court convicted 43 local and foreign NGO workers last month on charges of illegally using foreign funds to stir unrest in Egypt. The <strong><a class="InternalLink" href="http://www.infozine.com/news/stories/op/storiesView/sid/56175/">US</a></strong> and <strong><a class="InternalLink" href="http://www.nonprofitquarterly.org/policysocial-context/22431-un-concerned-about-egypt-s-conviction-of-43-ngo-workers.html#.UbUToHEpCG8">UN</a></strong> expressed concern over the move. </span></p>

<p style="line-height:150%"><span style="font-family:inherit;line-height:150%">Some Middle East observers suggested the US&#x2019; democracy push in Egypt may be more about buying influence than spreading human rights and good governance.</span></p>

<p style="line-height:150%"><span style="font-family:inherit;line-height:150%">&#x201C;Funding of politicians is a problem,&#x201D; said Robert Springborg, who evaluated democracy programmes for the State Department in Egypt, and is now a professor at the National Security Department of the Naval Postgraduate School at Monterey, California. </span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%"><span style="font-family:inherit;line-height:150%">&#x201C;If you run a programme for electoral observation, or for developing media capacity for political parties, I am not against that. But providing lots of money to politicians &#x2013; I think that raises lots of questions,&#x201D; Springborg said.</span></p>
<p style="background:none repeat scroll 0% 0% white;line-height:150%"><span style="font-family:inherit;line-height:150%">Some Egyptians, meanwhile, said the US was out of line by sending cash through its democracy programme in the Middle East to organisations run by political operators. </span></p>
<p style="background:none repeat scroll 0% 0% white;line-height:150%"><span style="font-family:inherit;line-height:150%">&#x201C;Instead of being sincere about backing democracy and reaching out to the Egyptian people, the US has chosen an unethical path,&#x201D; said Esam Neizamy, an independent researcher into foreign funding in Egypt, and a member of the country&#x2019;s Revolutionary Trustees, a group set up to protect the 2011 revolution.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%"><span style="font-family:inherit;line-height:150%">&#x201C;The Americans think they can outsmart lots of people in the Middle East. They are being very hostile against the Egyptian people who have nothing but goodwill for them &#x2013; so far,&#x201D; Neizamy said.</span></p>
