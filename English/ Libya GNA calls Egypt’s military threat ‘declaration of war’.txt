<p class="xmsonormal"><span>Libya&#x2019;s UN-recognised Government of National Accord (GNA) has denounced Egypt&#x2019;s warning of military intervention in Libya, labelling it a &#x201C;declaration of war&#x201D;.</span></p>
<p class="xmsonormal"><span>On Saturday, Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi warned that if pro-GNA forces advanced on the strategic city of Sirte &#x2013; some 450 kilometres (280 miles) east of the capital Tripoli &#x2013; it could provoke a &#x201C;direct&#x201D; intervention by Cairo.</span></p>
<p class="speakable">He also ordered the Egyptian army to be ready to carry out missions inside or outside of the country to protect its national security amid tensions over Turkey&#x2019;s intervention in Libya.</p>
<p class="xmsonormal">In response, the GNA said in a statement that Egypt&#x2019;s move was &#x201C;a hostile act and&#xA0;<span>direct interference, and amounts to a declaration of war&#x201D;.</span></p>
<p class="xmsonormal">The statement comes on the eve of a virtual meeting of Arab League foreign ministers on Libya, in which the GNA declined to participate.</p>
<p class="xmsonormal">For the Libyan state, &#x201C;interference in its internal affairs, attacks on its sovereignty, whether by declarations &#x2026; like those of the Egyptian president or by support for putschists, militias and mercenaries, is unacceptable&#x201D;, the GNA said.</p>
<p class="xmsonormal">It said it was open to &#x201C;all impartial mediation &#x2026; under the aegis of the UN&#x201D; but rejected &#x201C;unilateral or extrajudicial initiatives&#x201D;.</p>

<p class="xmsonormal">Oil-rich Libya has been mired in chaos since a NATO-backed 2011 uprising toppled longtime leader Muammar Gaddafi.</p>
<p class="xmsonormal">Since 2015, a power struggle has pitted the Tripoli-based GNA against renegade military commander Khalifa Haftar, who claims legitimacy from an eastern-based elected parliament.</p>
<p class="xmsonormal">Haftar has been trying unsuccessfully to seize the capital since April 2019, with support from Egypt, Russia and the United Arab Emirates.</p>

<p class="xmsonormal">Since the start of June, increased Turkish support has enabled pro-GNA forces to&#xA0; take control of northwest Libya, ending Haftar&#x2019;s assault on Tripoli.</p>
<p class="xmsonormal">The GNA advance is now halted outside the coastal city of Sirte, a strategic access point to Libya&#x2019;s key oil fields which remains under Haftar&#x2019;s control.</p>
<p class="xmsonormal">Sirte and Al-Jufra to the south represent a &#x201C;red line&#x201D;, el-Sisi said in a television broadcast on Saturday, citing the need to protect Egypt&#x2019;s porous border.</p>
<p class="xmsonormal">If this line is crossed, Egyptian forces will directly intervene in Libya, el-Sisi said.</p>
<p class="xmsonormal">&#x201C;All of Libya is a red line,&#x201D; the GNA responded. &#x201C;Whatever the dispute between Libyans, we will not allow our people to be insulted or threatened.&#x201D;</p>
<p class="xmsonormal">But the speaker of Libya&#x2019;s eastern-based parliament, Aguila Saleh, defended el-Sisi&#x2019;s declaration, saying in a Sunday statement that the Egyptian president was &#x201C;responding to our appeal to the Egyptian parliament&#x201D; last January in which Saleh called for Egyptian intervention in Libya.</p>
<p class="xmsonormal">And on Sunday, the Jordanian foreign ministry issued a statement saying Amman supports Cairo &#x201C;against any threat to the security and stability&#x201D; of Egypt.</p>
<p class="xmsonormal">It came after the foreign ministers of both countries discussed the Libya conflict over the phone.</p>
