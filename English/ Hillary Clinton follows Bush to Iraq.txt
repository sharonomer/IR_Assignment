<p>Clinton was spending one day in the insurgency-ridden Iraqi capital, during which she met top US civilian and military officials including US overseer Paul Bremer and ground forces commander Lieutenant General Ricardo Sanchez.&#xA0;</p>
<p>She also lunched with troops from her home state of New York in the dining hall at the former city centre palace of ousted&#xA0;leader Saddam Hussein, which is now the seat of the US-led occupation administration.&#xA0;</p>
<p>Unlike the US president, who never left the main military camp at Baghdad airport during his two-and-a-half hour stopover, Clinton then left the heavily fortified complex around the palace to go and visit troops.&#xA0;</p>
<p><strong>Hearts and minds</strong></p>
<p>She also met Iraqi officials, including the sole woman member of the US-installed interim cabinet, public works minister Nasrin Mustafa Sadiq Barwari.&#xA0;</p>

<p>Clinton warned that the&#xA0;US-led occupation still faced many enemies in Iraq and urged the US administration to change its reconstruction strategy to allow the United Nations a greater role in postwar Iraq.&#xA0;</p>
<p>&#x201C;It is no longer sufficient for our military to win battles but they have to win the hearts and minds. It is a very big challenge,&#x201D; said Clinton, who visited Baghdad as part of a tour of conflict zones that saw her spend Thanksgiving with US troops in Afghanistan.&#xA0;</p>
<p>&#x201C;We are&#xA0;in a very difficult political situation, trying to expedite a process for self-governance that will be very challenging,&#x201D; Clinton said. &#x201C;We have a lot of adversaries that wish us and the Iraqi people nothing but bad news.&#x201D;</p>
<p><strong>UN role</strong></p>
<p>Clinton said it was still not too late to give the United Nations a leading role in administering Iraq to relieve expense and pressure from the US-led occupiers, but was pessimistic this would take place.&#xA0;</p>

<p>&#x201C;We face a very big hill to climb. We face a complex security situation. The process of putting together self-governance in a short period of time is very difficult. We still need more help, more support from the international community.&#x201D;&#xA0;</p>
<p>&#x201C;I am a big believer that we ought to internationalise this, but it will take a big change in our administration&#x2019;s thinking,&#x201D; Clinton said. &#x201C;I don&#x2019;t see that it is&#xA0;forthcoming.&#x201D;&#xA0;</p>
<p>The former first lady, who is now a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said she had &#x201C;wanted to come to Iraq to let the troops know about the great job they are doing.&#x201D;</p>
