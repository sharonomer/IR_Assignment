<p>Hillary Clinton has blamed the FBI&#x2019;s decision to revive an investigation into her email accounts for her devastating <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/blogs/americas/2016/11/donald-trump-poll-victory-upends-predictions-161109110748125.html">defeat</a> in the US presidential election.</p>
<p>In a call on Saturday with top campaign donors, Clinton said her campaign was in the lead until FBI director James Comey sent a letter to Congress on October 28 announcing that the FBI had uncovered emails possibly related to its earlier investigation into her use of a private server as secretary of state.</p>
<p>The new examination was sparked by an unrelated investigation into former New York Representative Anthony Weiner, the estranged husband of one of her top aides.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/10/fbi-clinton-emails-investigation-161028185242864.html">surprise announcement</a> by the FBI came after three debates in which president-elect Donald Trump, a Republican, was widely panned for his performance. Clinton told the donors that her campaign was leading by large margins in nearly every battleground state and was tied in Arizona, a traditionally Republican stronghold, until Comey released his letter.</p>
<p>Trump&#x2019;s campaign and Republican supporters seized on the news, even though it was unclear whether Clinton&#x2019;s correspondence was tied up in the probe.</p>
<p>Comey told politicians the Sunday before the election that the bureau had <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/11/fbi-charges-hillary-clinton-emails-161106211815632.html">found no evidence</a> to warrant criminal charges. His &#x201C;all clear&#x201D; message only served to further motivate Trump supporters, Clinton told donors on the call.</p>
<p>In the nine days between Comey&#x2019;s initial statement and his &#x201C;all clear&#x201D; announcement, nearly 24 million people cast early ballots. That was roughly 18 percent of the expected total votes for president.</p>
<p>While Clinton accepted some blame of her loss, said donors who listened to her call, she made little mention of the many other factors political analysts saw as driving Trump&#x2019;s victory.</p>

<p>Clinton told her supporters on Saturday that her team had drafted a memo that looked at the changing opinion polls leading up to the election and that the letter from Comey proved to be a turning point.&#xA0;</p>
<p><span>The memo prepared by Clinton&#x2019;s campaign, a copy of which was seen by the Reuters news agency, said voters who decided which candidate to support in the last week were more likely to support Trump than Clinton.</span></p>
<p><span>&#x201C;In the end, late breaking developments in the race proved one hurdle too many for us to overcome,&#x201D; the memo concluded.</span></p>
<p><span>A spokesperson for the FBI could not immediately be reached for comment.</span></p>
<p>Democrats have spent much of this week reeling for their loss, with many in the party beginning a process of soul-searching designed to figure out what exactly went wrong. Liberals such as Senator Bernie Sanders and Senator Elizabeth Warren say Democrats must embrace a more aggressive economic message &#x2013; one Clinton largely shied away from during her campaign.</p>
