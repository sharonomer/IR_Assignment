<p>US President <a href="/topics/people/donald-trump.html">Donald Trump</a> has thrown his support behind Egyptian President <a href="/topics/people/abdel-fattah-el-sisi.html">Abdel Fattah el-Sisi</a>, who has come under pressure in the face of&#xA0;<a href="/news/2019/09/sisi-protests-egypt-190921091738593.html">protests&#xA0;calling for him to step down</a><span>&#xA0;in Egypt</span>.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Everybody has demonstrations,&#x201D; Trump said on Monday while meeting el-Sisi on the sidelines of the 74th session of the UN&#xA0;General Assembly in New York City.</p>
<p>&#x201C;I&#x2019;m not concerned with it. Egypt has a great leader. He&#x2019;s highly respected.&#x201D;</p>
<p>In a rare display of dissent, thousands of protesters <span>on Friday and Saturday&#xA0;</span>defied a de facto ban on demonstrations as they took to the streets in central Cairo and several other cities to call for el-Sisi&#x2019;s departure.</p>
<p>In the port city of Suez, security forces on Saturday <a href="/news/2019/09/clashes-egypt-suez-day-protests-el-sisi-190922061638227.html">clashed with hundreds of protesters</a>,&#xA0;firing tear gas and live rounds as they moved in to disperse the crowd.</p>
<p>On Monday, a rights group said more than 500 people had been arrested across the country since the protests began.</p>
<p>&#x201C;The latest count of those arrested over the events since Friday in Cairo and other provinces has risen to 516,&#x201D; the Egyptian Centre for Economic and Social Rights said in a statement.</p>
<h2>&#x2018;Favourite dictator&#x2019;&#xA0;</h2>
<p>The protests came in response to <a href="/news/2019/09/egyptian-businessman-calls-president-el-sisi-step-190919091741745.html">calls for el-Sisi to step down by Mohamed Ali</a>, a&#xA0;building contractor and actor who accused the president and the military of corruption in a series of videos posted online.</p>
<p>From self-imposed exile in Spain, Ali has called for a &#x201C;million-man march&#x201D; on Friday and for protesters to fill all &#x201C;major squares&#x201D; of the country.</p>
<p>Discontent over the rising cost of living has been swelling in <a href="/topics/country/egypt.html">Egypt</a>, where the government has imposed strict austerity measures since 2016 as part of a $12bn loan package from the International Monetary Fund. Nearly one in three Egyptians live below the poverty line on less than $1.40 a day, according to official figures released in July. Other estimates put the figure higher.&#xA0;</p>
<p><span>El-Sisi has dismissed the corruption allegations as &#x201C;lies&#x201D; and &#x201C;slander&#x201D;.&#xA0;<span>When asked about the demonstrations, the Egyptian president on Monday blamed them on &#x201C;political Islam&#x201D;.</span></span></p>
<p>A former army general, el-Sisi led the military removal of&#xA0;<span>democratically elected</span>&#xA0;<a href="/topics/people/mohamed-morsi.html">Mohamed Morsi</a> in 2013 and has since won back-to-back landslide elections after running virtually unopposed.</p>
<p>During his time in office, he<span>&#xA0;has overseen a broad crackdown on dissent, including the jailing of thousands of dissidents and the effective banning of protests.</span></p>

<p>Human rights groups have long raised concerns about the el-Sisi government&#x2019;s human rights record, but Trump on Monday insisted his Egyptian counterpart &#x201C;has done some things that are absolutely amazing in a short period of time&#x201D;.</p>
<p>&#x201C;When he took over, it was in turmoil. But it&#x2019;s not in turmoil any more. I just wanted to say we have a long-term great relationship. It&#x2019;s better than ever before,&#x201D; Trump said.</p>
<p>Earlier this month,&#xA0;The Wall Street Journal <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-awaiting-egyptian-counterpart-at-summit-called-out-for-my-favorite-dictator-11568403645" target="_blank">reported</a> that Trump referred to el-Sisi as his &#x201C;favourite dictator&#x201D; as he waited for him at the G7 summit in France in August.</p>
<p>Witnesses among the small gathering of US and Egyptian officials said they believed Trump was joking, but the comment nonetheless drew attention&#xA0;to criticism about el-Sisi&#x2019;s authoritarian rule and rampant human rights abuses in Egypt, as well as Washington&#x2019;s tacit approval.</p>
<h2>&#x2018;Our lawyers can&#x2019;t keep up&#x2019;</h2>
<p>Since the protests erupted, security forces have reinforced their presence in central Cairo and plain-clothes officers have been stopping people to check the&#xA0;<span>social media content on their mobile phones, according to reports.</span>&#xA0;<span>Al Jazeera is banned from reporting inside Egypt.</span></p>
<p>&#x201C;Our lawyers can&#x2019;t keep up,&#x201D; said&#xA0;Gamal Eid, director of the Arab Network for Human Rights Information, commenting&#xA0;on the growing number of arrests in different parts of the country,</p>
<p>Among those detained is prominent human rights lawyer Mahienour El-Massry, who was <a href="/news/2019/09/egyptian-authorities-detain-award-winning-human-rights-lawyer-190922194805122.html">arrested late on Sunday</a> as she walked out of the state prosecutor&#x2019;s office in Cairo, where she was representing detainees.</p>
<p>A judicial official said el-Massry had been placed in pre-trial detention for 15 days on charges of &#x201C;taking part with a terrorist group to achieve its goals and publishing false news&#x201D;, according to AFP news agency.</p>
