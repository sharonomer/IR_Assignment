<p>Democratic presidential hopefuls Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders have sparred over who is more committed to US immigration reform at a presidential debate in Miami.</p>
<p>Debating on Wednesday evening, a few days before Florida&#x2019;s crucial primary election, both candidates promised they would not deport undocumented immigrants without criminal records.</p>
<p>Clinton and Sanders took turns thrashing Republican frontrunner Donald Trump for his vow to round up and kick out millions of undocumented immigrants, with Clinton accusing him of &#x201C;trafficking in paranoia&#x201D;.</p>

<p>&#x201C;I think the American people are never going to elect a president who insults Mexicans, who insults Muslims, who insults women, who insults African-Americans,&#x201D; Sanders said.</p>
<p>Earlier on Wednesday, Republican leaders opposed to Trump becoming the party&#x2019;s presidential candidate in the November US election warned that the billionaire businessman could become unstoppable if he wins two crucial nominating contests next week.</p>
<h2>Mexico border wall</h2>
<p>Clinton got some laughs by saying that Trump wants to build &#x201C;a beautiful, tall wall&#x201D; that will &#x201C;magically&#x201D; be paid for by the Mexican government. </p>
<p> Her comments came in response to a question on whether her vote as a New York senator to build a wall on the southern border differs from Trump&#x2019;s plan, which she has called ridiculous.</p>
<p>Clinton said responsible legislators chose to improve border security with more agents and some fencing when needed, and as a result the country has lower rates of illegal immigration.</p>

<p>Once again <a class="internallink" href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2015/10/clinton-takes-responsibility-benghazi-attack-151022211612239.html" target="_blank">Clinton defended her role </a> in the deadly 2012 attack on the American mission in Benghazi, Libya. </p>
<p> She said at Wednesday&#x2019;s debate that her shifting explanations for the crisis in the early hours were because of changing dynamics and new information.</p>
<p>Clinton also said the investigation has been politicised by Republicans seeking to score points against her campaign.</p>
<p>&#x201C;This was fog of war,&#x201D; she said, saying that she regrets the lives lost in the crisis.&#xA0;She added: &#x201C;I wish there could be an easy answer at the time but we learned a lot.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Sanders boasted at the debate that his upset win in <a class="internallink" href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/03/donald-trump-hillary-clinton-primaries-160309032347524.html" target="_blank">Michigan&#x2019;s primary</a> the day before over Clinton had rejuvenated his campaign.</p>
<p>Sanders pointed out that some observers considered the victory, which was not forecast by opinion polls, &#x201C;one of the major political upsets in modern American history&#x201D;, saying the win&#xA0;strengthened his case for being the party&#x2019;s nominee.</p>
<p>The senator from Vermont said the task before him was to convince the so-called Democratic &#x201C;superdelegates,&#x201D; party elites who have largely sided with Clinton, that he &#x201C;is the strongest candidate to defeat Donald Trump,&#x201D; Sanders said.</p>
<p>Asked about the Michigan loss, Clinton said. &#x201C;It was a close race. I&#x2019;ve won some. I&#x2019;ve lost some.&#x201D;</p>
