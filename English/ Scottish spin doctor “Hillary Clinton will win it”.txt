<p>Simon Pia has been at the cut and thrust of the Scottish political scene for too long not to spot a grim but mesmerising election campaign when he sees one.</p>
<p>A one-time media adviser &#x2013; or &#x201C;spin doctor&#x201D; &#x2013; to two Scottish Labour Party leaders at the Scottish parliament, the man from Edinburgh says he is sure who will win today&#x2019;s 2016 US Presidential race, but is equally intrigued about how the American electorate became lumbered with the two most disliked presidential nominees in recent US history.</p>
<p>&#x201C;I think Hillary Clinton will win it,&#x201D; he told Al Jazeera. &#x201C;But I think what is interesting is that the Republican Party machine broke down and Donald Trump won the nomination, whereas it was the Democratic machine that ensured Hillary got the nomination.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Pia, today plying his trade as a journalism lecturer, told Al Jazeera that US support for Trump, whose late mother hailed from the Isle of Lewis, off the Scottish west coast, and whose golf course-owning ambitions in Scotland have caused great domestic controversy, was a big &#x201C;f*** you vote from Middle America&#x201D;.</p>
<p>&#x201C;The only bit of credit I would give to Trump is that he is a master manipulator of the tabloid media,&#x201D; he added.</p>
<p>So is it safe to assume that Pia is praying for a Clinton victory?</p>
<p>&#x201C;I would vote for Clinton with a nose-peg &#x2013; I think she is tainted,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;The one hope I have is that if Trump did win, he&#x2019;s such a narcissist, he would just be happy to be president and leave others to do the heavy lifting.&#x201D;</p>
