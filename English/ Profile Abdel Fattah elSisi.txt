<p>Abdel Fattah el-Sisi is the sixth Egyptian president, re-elected in March 2018 with 97 percent of the votes.</p>
<p>This is the story of a field marshal turned president:</p>
<h2>Upbringing</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Born in 1954, el-Sisi was raised in el-Gamaliya, in an alleyway that lies on the edge of the&#x202F;Jewish quarter&#x202F;of Cairo&#x2019;s old city.&#xA0;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&#x201C;I was born and raised in an area with immense cultural diversity&#x2026; and I used to see the synagogue in the Jewish quarter,&#x201D; el-Sisi later recalled in&#xA0;<span>a TV interview.&#xA0;</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Although he was never in active combat, three wars between <a href="/topics/country/egypt.html">Egypt</a> and <a href="/topics/country/israel.html">Israel</a> broke out during his lifetime.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Egypt fought three wars with Israel in his early years, the last of which was in 1973, when he was 19.</span></p>
</li>
<li>Upon graduating from the military academy in 1977, el-Sisi married his maternal cousin&#xA0;Entissar Amer. They have three sons and a daughter.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Defence Minister</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>El-Sisi continued his military training at the UK Joint Services Command and Staff College in 1992 and received a master&#x2019;s degree from the US Army War College in Pennsylvania in 2006.</p>
</li>
<li class="_mce_tagged_br">
<p>After serving as security chief at the military attache office in Saudi Arabia, el-Sisi returned to Egypt in 2008 as chief of staff of the northern military zone.</p>
</li>
<li class="_mce_tagged_br">
<p>In February 2011, shortly after the Egyptian revolution, a military council assumed control of the country and a<span>ppointed el-Sisi as the head of military intelligence.</span></p>
</li>
<li class="_mce_tagged_br">
<p>El-Sisi was publicly criticised for defending &#x201C;virginity tests&#x201D; carried out on female protesters during the revolution, which he said were conducted to &#x201C;protect girls from rape as well as the army from possible allegations&#x201D;.</p>
</li>
<li class="_mce_tagged_br">
<p>In 2012, elected&#xA0;President <a href="/topics/people/mohamed-morsi.html">Mohamed Morsi</a>&#xA0;appointed el-Sisi as minister of defence and commander-in-chief of the armed forces. One year later, <a href="/news/middleeast/2013/07/20137319828176718.html">he toppled the president</a>.</p>

<h2>Coup d&#x2019;etat &#xA0;</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>El-Sisi&#x2019;s ascent to power came about in the summer of 2013, during massive anti-Morsi protests planned for June 30.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Amid calls for President Morsi to step down, el-Sisi issued a 48-hour ultimatum for the president to &#x201C;<span>meet the demands of the people,&#x201D; or call for early elections.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Citing electoral legitimacy, Morsi <a href="/news/middleeast/2013/07/20137394753443155.html">proposed</a> to form a new&#xA0;consensus government,&#xA0;but the military nonetheless went ahead and deposed him once the deadline expired on July 3.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On July 3, in a pivotal <a href="/news/middleeast/2013/07/201373203740167797.html">statement</a> in Egyptian politics, el-Sisi announced the overthrow of Egypt&#x2019;s first democratically elected president, the temporary suspension of the constitution, and <a href="/news/middleeast/2013/07/20137322150549685.html">the appointment</a> of a judge as temporary president until new elections were held.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Although el-Sisi promised to guarantee freedom of expression, the military-backed interim government went on to outlaw all activities and organisations related to the former president&#x2019;s party, the <a href="/indepth/features/2017/06/muslim-brotherhood-explained-170608091709865.html">Muslim Brotherhood</a>, and embarked on a campaign of arresting and silencing its supporters.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2><span><span><span><span>Rabaa massacre</span> </span> </span> </span></h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Since the overthrow of President Morsi in July 2013, thousands of his supporters camped on the streets demanding his release.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In August 2013, the army <a href="/programmes/aljazeeraworld/2016/08/massacre-rabaa-160816085846897.html">forcefully dispersed</a><a href="/programmes/aljazeeraworld/2016/08/massacre-rabaa-160816085846897.html">&#xA0;</a>demonstrations in Rabaa al-Adawiya Square in Cairo, resulting in the death of about 1,000 people.&#xA0;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="/topics/organisations/human-rights-watch.html">Human Rights Watch</a>&#xA0;<span>described the massacre as &#x201C;one of the largest killings of demonstrators in a single day in recent history&#x201D;.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In November 2013, a law was passed <a href="/news/2016/12/161203135310856.html">banning demonstrations</a>&#xA0;unless they had prior police approval.&#xA0;</p>

<h2>Becoming president</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Initially, el-Sisi denied any intentions to hold the office, and in the run-up to the 2014 elections he said: &#x201C;you just can&#x2019;t believe that there are people who don&#x2019;t aspire for authority.&#x201D;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>But on March 26, 2014, he confirmed expectations by announcing that he would resign from the military to run for president later that year.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&#x201C;I have spent all my life as a soldier for the sake of the country &#x2026;&#xA0;I am telling you that I intend to run for the president of Egypt, and this support from you will give me this honour,&#x201D; he declared.</p>
</li>
<li><span>On June 3, 2014, he was declared the winner of the presidential election with 96.9 percent of the vote.</span></li>
</ul>
