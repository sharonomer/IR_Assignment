<p dir="ltr"><span>The stunning loss of Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton to her Republican rival, Donald Trump, has many people wondering how it happened.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr">It seemed like the United States was ready for its first female leader, but many Americans did not care; they wanted a different kind of change.</p>
<p>Republican Donald Trump was brash, offensive and underestimated.</p>
<p>Yet, he had the backing of large swaths of the country, for whom he was a political outsider.</p>

<p dir="ltr"><span>From an email scandal to questions about her family&#x2019;s charitable foundation, there were signs early on that, contrary to her campaign slogan, Americans were not ready for another Clinton presidency.</span></p>
<p>Scandals haunted her entire campaign, giving fuel to the idea that she was secretive and corrupt.</p>
<p>It also did not help that Wikileaks released tens of thousands of hacked emails from campaign staff, affirming many people&#x2019;s suspicions about a potential cover-up.</p>
<p>In the final three weeks, with Clinton leading in most polls, the FBI dropped a bombshell.</p>
<p>They began to re-examine staff emails, believing they may have overlooked something.&#xA0;</p>
<p>&#x201C;It killed her campaign in the sense that it reinforced all of the misgivings and uncertainties that people have had about the Clintons for years,&#x201D; Lara Brown, <span>an associate professor of political management at&#xA0;</span><span>George Washington University</span>, told &#xA0;Al Jazeera.&#xA0;</p>

<p>Even those who supported her admitted it was a &#x201C;tough decision&#x201D;, while others, fed up with both candidates, opted to back a third party.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Hillary Clinton wanted to break what she referred to as the glass ceiling for women in American politics,&#x201D; said Al Jazeera&#x2019;s Kimberly Halkett, reporting from Washington DC. &#x201C;They will have to wait at least another four years to do it.&#x201D;&#xA0;</p>
