<p>US President <a href="/news/2016/11/profile-president-donald-trump-161109050153947.html">Donald Trump</a> reportedly mocked Egypt&#x2019;s President <a href="/news/middleeast/2013/07/201373112752442652.html">Abdel Fattah el-Sisi</a> and referred to him as a &#x201C;f***ing killer&#x201D;, according to investigative journalist Bob Woodward.</p>
<p>In an <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/trump-called-egypt-president-sissi-killer-after-partnership-book-claims-1115728" target="_blank">excerpt</a> from Woodward&#x2019;s recently released book,&#xA0;Fear: Trump in the White House, the US leader made the remarks after&#xA0;<a href="/news/2017/04/aya-hijazi-meets-donald-trump-egypt-170421233542026.html">securing the release</a> of Aya Hijazi, an American Egyptian who was detained by Cairo for three years.</p>
<p>Woodward claimed that Trump was talking to then-White House legal adviser John Dowd about his negotiations with Sisi over Hijazi&#x2019;s release.</p>
<p>Trump reportedly told Dowd: &#x201C;Remember who I&#x2019;m talking to. The guy&#x2019;s a f***ing killer. This guy&#x2019;s a f***ing killer! I&#x2019;m getting it done. He&#x2019;ll make you sweat on the phone.</p>
<p>The book then describes Trump as assuming a &#x201C;deep grovelling voice&#x201D; apparently intending to mimic Sisi &#x2013; &#x201C;Donald, I&#x2019;m worried about this [Mueller] investigation. Are you going to be around? Suppose I need a favour, Donald?&#x201D;</p>

<p>According to Woodward, Trump called Sisi&#x2019;s comments, which were apparently in reference to <a href="/news/2017/10/trump-russia-probe-171031123655241.html">Robert Mueller&#x2019;s investigation</a> into alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 elections, a &#x201C;kick in the nuts&#x201D;.</p>
<p>Hijazi was released from jail in April 2017, after nearly three years of imprisonment on human trafficking charges, which were widely dismissed as bogus by <a href="/topics/categories/human_rights.html">human rights</a> groups.</p>
<p>Weeks earlier, Trump had invited Sisi to the White House, something former President <a href="/news/americas/2012/11/201211701337949862.html">Barack Obama</a> had never done, and described him as a &#x201C;fantastic guy&#x201D;.</p>
<p>Less than a year later, when Sisi won Egypt&#x2019;s election with 97 percent of the vote, Trump expressed his &#x201C;sincere congratulations&#x201D; to Sisi in a phone call.</p>
<h2>Erratic and&#xA0;<span>uninformed</span></h2>
<p>Woodward&#x2019;s book, which was released on Tuesday after a widely publicised buildup, paints a highly-critical picture of life inside the Oval Office, painting Trump&#x2019;s character as dangerously erratic and uninformed.</p>
<p>It also claimed that Trump wanted to assassinate Syrian President <a href="/news/middleeast/2007/07/200852518514154964.html">Bashar al-Assad</a> after an alleged chemical attack last April.</p>
<p>The book quoted Trump as saying: &#x201C;Let&#x2019;s f***ing kill him! Let&#x2019;s go in. Let&#x2019;s kill the f***ing lot of them&#x201D;.</p>
<p>On the eve of its release, Trump took to Twitter to denounce Woodward&#x2019;s accounts as works of &#x201C;fiction&#x201D;.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">The Woodward book is a Joke &#x2013; just another assault against me, in a barrage of assaults, using now disproven unnamed and anonymous sources. Many have already come forward to say the quotes by them, like the book, are fiction. Dems can&#x2019;t stand losing. I&#x2019;ll write the real book!</p>

<p>Cairo and Washington have forged close ties under Trump after years of tension under the&#xA0;<a href="/topics/people/barack-obama.html">Obama</a>&#xA0;administration.</p>
<p>Obama temporarily halted military aid to Egypt after the Sisi-led overthrow of Egypt&#x2019;s first freely elected president,&#xA0;<a href="/topics/people/mohamed-morsi.html">Mohamed Morsi</a>, a member of the&#xA0;<a href="/topics/organisations/muslim-brotherhood.html">Muslim Brotherhood</a>, in 2013. His administration also repeatedly criticised the Egyptian government&#x2019;s crackdown on political opponents.</p>
<p>Since the July 2013 coup, a police crackdown against the Muslim Brotherhood &#x2013; which maintains it is peaceful but has been designated by&#xA0;Egypt&#x2019;s government as a &#x201C;terrorist&#x201D; group &#x2013;&#xA0;has left hundreds dead and tens of thousands in jail.&#xA0;</p>
<p>Last year, a UN investigation found that <a href="/topics/country/egypt.html">Egypt</a> engages in the continuous persecution of women, human rights activists, and journalists.</p>
<p>Human rights groups estimate that at least 40,000 political prisoners have been detained by Sisi&#x2019;s government.</p>
