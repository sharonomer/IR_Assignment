<p>An Egyptian court has sentenced former president Mohamed Morsi and 19 others to three years in prison on charges of insulting the judiciary.</p>
<p>Morsi, democratically elected after Egypt&#x2019;s 2011 revolution, was deposed following mass protests and a military coup in July 2013.</p>
<p>He served just one year of a four-year term, while the organisation to which he belonged, the <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/topics/organisations/muslim-brotherhood.html">Muslim Brotherhood</a>, has since been outlawed.</p>
<p>A government crackdown on the movement, as well as other groups, has since resulted in tens of thousands of arrests and mass trials.</p>
<p>On Saturday, the Cairo Criminal Court convicted Morsi of defaming the judiciary in a speech he made while in office&#xA0;&#x201C;with the aim of spreading hate&#x201D;, according to state television.</p>
<p>The court ordered Morsi to pay one million Egyptian pounds ($56,270) as compensation to a judge, whom Morsi had accused of overseeing fraud in a previous election.</p>

<p>Five other accused, including prominent pro-democracy campaigner Alaa Abdel-Fatah, were ordered to pay a fine of 30,000 Egyptian pounds ($1,700) each. </p>
<p>All the rulings can be appealed.</p>
<p>Since his removal, Morsi has been tried in several different cases.</p>
<p>He is already serving a 20-year sentence in another case, on charges of inciting attacks on protesters in 2012.</p>
<p>In September, the top appeals court upheld a separate 25-year term, on charges of harming national security by leaking state documents to <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/qatar.html">Qatar</a>.</p>
