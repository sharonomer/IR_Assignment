<p>US President <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/topics/people/donald-trump.html">Donald Trump</a>&#xA0;has grudgingly signed into law new sanctions against <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/russia.html">Russia</a>, a move Moscow says amounted to a full-scale trade war and an end to hopes for better ties with Washington.</p>
<p>Congress overwhelmingly approved the legislation last week, passing a measure that conflicts with the Republican president&#x2019;s desire to improve relations with Russia.</p>
<p>While Trump signed the bill <span>on Wednesday</span>, he criticised it as infringing on his powers to shape foreign policy and said he could make &#x201C;far better deals&#x201D; with governments than Congress can.</p>
<p>Dmitry Medvedev, <span>Russia&#x2019;s prime minister,</span>&#xA0;called the sanctions tantamount to a &#x201C;full-scale trade war,&#x201D; adding in a <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/topics/organisations/facebook.html">Facebook</a> post that they showed the Trump administration had demonstrated &#x201C;utter powerlessness&#x201D;.</p>

<p>&#x201C;The hope that our relations with the new American administration would improve is finished,&#x201D; he wrote.</p>
<p>Trump&#x2019;s litany of concerns about the sanctions, which also affect <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/iran.html">Iran</a> and North Korea, nonetheless raised the question of how vigorously Trump will enforce them and pursue action against Russia.</p>
<p>&#x201C;While I favour tough measures to punish and deter aggressive and destabilising behaviour by Iran, North Korea, and Russia, this legislation is significantly flawed,&#x201D; Trump said in a message to legislators.</p>
<p>The new law allows Congress to stop any effort by Trump to ease sanctions on Russia.</p>
<p>Trump said in a separate statement that he was signing the measure &#x201C;for the sake of national unity&#x201D;, even though he saw problems with it.</p>
<h2>&#x2018;Raises serious questions&#x2019;</h2>
<p>His hands were tied after the Republican-controlled congress approved the legislation by such a large margin last week that any presidential veto of the bill would have been overridden.</p>
<p>Congress passed the measure to punish Russia over interference in the 2016 US <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/topics/events/election-2016.html">presidential election</a> and the annexation of Ukraine&#x2019;s Crimea.</p>
<p>The legislation has provoked countermeasures by Russian President <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/topics/people/vladimir-putin.html">Vladimir Putin</a>, who said on Sunday the US diplomatic mission in Russia must <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/07/russia-expels-755-diplomats-response-sanctions-170730201720880.html">reduce</a> its staff by 755 people. Russia is also seizing two properties near Moscow used by American diplomats.</p>

<p>Trump has repeatedly said he wants to improve relations with Russia. That desire has been stymied by US intelligence agencies&#x2019; findings that Russia interfered to help the Republican against Democratic presidential candidate <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/topics/people/hillary-clinton.html">Hillary Clinton</a>.</p>
<p>US congressional panels and a special counsel are investigating. Moscow denies any meddling and Trump denies any collusion by his campaign.</p>
<p>Republican House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan welcomed the signing, saying in a statement it would send &#x201C;a powerful message to our adversaries that they will be held accountable for their actions&#x201D;.</p>
<p>But Republican Senator Lindsey Graham said he was disappointed that Trump chose to sign the legislation behind closed doors, without the fanfare of television cameras and reporters present.</p>
<p>&#x201C;The fact (that) he does this kind of quietly I think reinforces the narrative that the Trump administration is not really serious about pushing back on Russia,&#x201D; Graham said in a CNN interview.</p>
<p>The House&#x2019;s top Democrat, Nancy Pelosi, expressed concern about Trump&#x2019;s signing statement, saying it &#x201C;raises serious questions about whether his administration intends to follow the law, or whether he will continue to enable and reward Vladimir Putin&#x2019;s aggression.&#x201D;</p>
<h2>The new sanctions</h2>
<p>Besides angering Moscow, the legislation has upset the <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/topics/organisations/european-union.html">European Union</a>, which has said the new sanctions might affect its energy security and prompt it to act, too.</p>
<p>Several provisions of the law target the Russian energy sector, with new limits on US investment in Russian companies.</p>
<p>American companies also would be barred from participating in energy exploration projects where Russian firms have a stake of 33 percent or higher.</p>

<p>The legislation includes sanctions on foreign companies investing in or helping Russian energy exploration, although the president could waive those sanctions.</p>
<p>It would give the Trump administration the option of imposing sanctions on companies helping develop Russian export pipelines, such as the Nord Stream 2 pipeline carrying natural gas to <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/topics/regions/europe.html">Europe</a>, in which German companies are involved.</p>
<p><span>Iran also spoke out against the sanctions, which it called a bid to&#xA0;</span><span>sabotage the 2015 nuclear deal &#x2013; but said it would not retaliate</span><span>.&#xA0;</span></p>
<p><span>&#x201C;We will not react with countermeasures, instead we will refuse to be&#xA0;</span><span>drawn into this game and proceed with a level head,&#x201D; Deputy Foreign&#xA0;</span><span>Minister Abbas Araghchi said, according to the ISNA news agency.</span></p>
