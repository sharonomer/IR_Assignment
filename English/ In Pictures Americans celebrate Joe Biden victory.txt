<p>Jubilant Americans celebrated the election of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris as the nation&#x2019;s next president and vice president &#x2013; honking horns, cheering and dancing in the streets across the United States.</p>
<p>Supporters of President Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pence turned out to express their disapproval and to back the president, who has not conceded and vowed a legal fight.</p>
<p>After Pennsylvania became the state that put Biden over the 270-vote threshold in the Electoral College, impromptu street parties broke out from Philadelphia to New York to Harris&#x2019; hometown of Oakland, California, where supporters in face masks held up campaign signs beneath a theatre marquee reading &#x201C;Every vote must be counted.&#x201D;</p>
<p>In Washington, DC, crowds rallied in the recently redubbed Black Lives Matter Plaza just steps from the White House and the site of large protests against racial injustice earlier this year. Outside Vaughn&#x2019;s Lounge in New Orleans, revellers bathed in a champagne shower.</p>
<p>The mood was grim among Trump backers near the Michigan Capitol in Lansing, where a woman in a campaign T-shirt held up a crucifix, a glum expression on her face. In North Las Vegas, outside the local elections department offices, an armed supporter of the president raised a defiant fist in the air as red, white and blue Trump flags fluttered.</p>
<p>There were also pro-Trump demonstrations from Atlanta to Philadelphia. The latter, like some other cities, saw people from opposite camps come face-to-face, leading to some shouting and arguing back and forth.</p>
