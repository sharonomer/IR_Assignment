<p>&#x201C;Members of the brotherhood were arrested Friday in Alexandria, some of them as they were eating in a restaurant,&#x201D; Issam al-Aryan, a spokesman for the group, said.</p>
<p>He said that among those rounded up was Helmi al-Gazzar, a local leader in Cairo who was also picked up during a wave of demonstrations last year and jailed for five months.</p>
<p>According to the movement&#x2019;s website, another local brotherhood official, Hassan al-Brens, was also detained in the latest sweep.</p>
<p>A&#xA0;statement posted on the site said: &#x201C;These arrests are the result of an escalation by the Egyptian government, which is cracking down on the Muslim Brothers in response to the movement&#x2019;s activities in parliament.&#x201D;</p>
<p><strong>Officially banned</strong></p>
<p>Thirty Brotherhood members have been detained since the beginning of last month, including Rashad Mohammed el-Bayoumy, a 70-year-old university professor and senior member of the group.</p>
<p>The Islamist movement is officially banned in Egypt but it fielded candidates as independents in last year&#x2019;s parliamentary polls and won a fifth of seats in the People&#x2019;s Assembly.</p>
<p>With 88 of the chamber&#x2019;s 454 seats, the Muslim Brotherhood is by far the largest opposition force and has adopted a stance of challenging the government&#x2019;s policies during parliamentary sessions.</p>
<p>The Egyptian authorities can hold detainees for up to six months without trial under much-criticised emergency laws introduced in 1981 after Islamist militants assassinated Anwar Sadat, the president.</p>
