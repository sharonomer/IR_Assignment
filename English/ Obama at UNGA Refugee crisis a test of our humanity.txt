<p><strong> New York </strong> &#x2013; Calling the refugee crisis &#x201C;one of the urgent tests of our time&#x201D; and &#x201C;a test of our common humanity&#x201D;, US President Barack Obama kicked off his Leaders&#x2019; Summit on Refugees.</p>
<p>The meeting came a day after member states at the UN General Assembly adopted the <a class="internallink" href="http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2016/09/analysis-refugee-pledge-late-160919142041084.html" target="_blank"> New York Declaration on Refugees </a> , which ultimately gives them two more years to negotiate their strategies and obligations on the refugee crisis.</p>
<p>Some 50 world leaders took part in Obama&#x2019;s summit on Tuesday. Their participation was conditional on making new commitments to address the global crisis.</p>
<p>The detailed list of who pledged what has not been released, but a White House statement issued early in the evening said that the cumulative commitments amounted to a $4.5bn increase over 2015 levels and participating countries &#x201C;doubled the number of refugees they resettled or afforded other legal channels of admission&#x201D;. It also said that access to education and legal work for refugees was improved.</p>
<p>&#x201C;I do think there&#x2019;s a general feeling that things have hit some sort of a tipping point &#x2013; the combination of events around the wold, and the fact that Syria keeps getting&#xA0;unbelievably worse&#x201D; said Kate Phillips-Barrasso, senior director for policy and advocacy at the International Rescue Committee.</p>
<p>As world leaders took the podium to speak, each defended his or her own country&#x2019;s track record in dealing with the <a href="http://www.unhcr.org/en-us/news/latest/2016/6/5763b65a4/global-forced-displacement-hits-record-high.html" target="_blank"> 65 million people </a> who have fled their homes around the world.</p>
<p>The United States itself has been accused of being slow to step up its efforts in taking in Syrian refugees, but has been making strides &#x2013; in the 2016 fiscal year it took in <a class="internallink" href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/08/syria-war-takes-10000-refugees-year-160830072845133.html" target="_blank"> 10,000 Syrians </a> , a significant increase from 2015, when it took in 1,862.</p>
<p>Like governments in many other countries, the Obama administration is dealing with domestic political resistance &#x2013; more than half of US state governors&#xA0; <a class="internallink" href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2015/11/islamophobia-syrian-refugees-usa-governors-151116164708308.html" target="_blank"> said </a> &#xA0;in 2015 that they did not want Syrian refugees settled there.</p>

<p>Some Eastern European states have sealed borders, asking their neighbouring states to do the same. There is a push <a class="internallink" href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/09/france-dismantle-remaining-calais-jungle-160902191457146.html" target="_blank"> in France </a> to empty the Calais &#x201C;Jungle&#x201D; &#x2013; the encampment holding at least 7,000 migrants and refugees, including 900 unaccompanied minors &#x2013; into the UK, which, in turn, has expressed an interest in <a class="internallink" href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/09/uk-slated-planned-anti-refugee-wall-calais-160907155338261.html" target="_blank"> walling off the port </a> to keep migrants out.</p>
<p>Australia wants the refugees and migrants&#xA0;<a class="internallink" href="http://www.aljazeera.com/blogs/asia/2016/09/australia-complex-refugee-debate-160916044343610.html" target="_blank">detained </a> and <a class="internallink" href="http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2016/04/outsourcing-refugees-survive-cambodia-160401115815935.html" target="_blank"> resettled </a> off its shores. Most of Europe wants Turkey to keep the 2.5 million refugees it is hosting there, and is willing to give <a class="internallink" href="http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2016/04/outsourcing-refugees-survive-cambodia-160401115815935.html" target="_blank"> financial incentives </a> to make it happen.</p>
<p>According to the <a href="http://www.unhcr.ie/about-unhcr/facts-and-figures-about-refugees" target="_blank"> UN&#x2019;s refugee agency </a> , after Syria, most refugees come from Afghanistan (2.4 million) &#x2013; with the majority ending up in Iran and Pakistan, where they are vulnerable to <a class="internallink" href="http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2016/05/afghan-refugees-leaving-iran-160511103759873.html" target="_blank"> abuse </a> , exploitation and <a class="internallink" href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/08/afghans-expelled-pakistan-dire-aid-160822070705057.html" target="_blank"> deportation </a> .</p>
<h2>Pledges, and then &#x2026;?</h2>
<p>It is too soon to say whether Obama&#x2019;s summit will mean the international community has met the challenge of the refugee issue, said Josephine Liebl, who leads Oxfam&#x2019;s UK policy and advocacy on humanitarian crisis.</p>
<p>&#x201C;The UN Summit gave us [the]&#xA0;<a class="internallink" href="http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2016/09/analysis-refugee-pledge-late-160919142041084.html" target="_blank"> NY Declaration </a> &#x2013; these were nice words but what we actually need is concrete action,&#x201D; she told Al Jazeera.</p>
<p>&#x201C;The next two years will be key &#x2026; We would have wanted this to be the start of a more sane and humane approach to the crisis. But we need to wait to see whether governments will actually go back home and practise what they signed up for,&#x201D; said Liebl.</p>
<p>Employing the same pay-to-play strategy he used at last year&#x2019;s UN General Assembly, when he called member states to the mat for peacekeeping pledges, Obama drew 52 nations and organisations into the room on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Although the 2015 peacekeeping summit seemed to yield <a href="http://futurepeaceops.org/664-2/" target="_blank"> significant pledges </a> &#xA0;for peacekeeping troops, equipment and other support, fulfilment has been an issue.</p>
<p>The bulk of the 47 countries making pledges in 2015 have <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-un-peacekeepers-idUSKCN0Z22WC" target="_blank"> failed </a> thus far to meet those obligations.</p>
<p>The possibility of member states not honouring their pledges is &#x201C;an important question,&#x201D; said Brooke Lauten, humanitarian policy and protection adviser at the Norwegian Refugee Council.</p>
<p>There are mechanisms to monitor and pressure states to follow through with their pledges. But real consequences are few, she said.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Will the wrath of the world community come down on them? No,&#x201D; said Lauten.</p>
<p>The&#xA0;likelihood of member states throwing money at the refugee issue rather than committing to accepting and resettling refugees is &#x201C;a huge, huge concern&#x201D;, she said.</p>
<p>&#x201C;The EU-Turkey deal is essentially the commodification&#xA0;of refugees,&#x201D; said Lauten.</p>
<p>&#x201C;They have become a commodity that you can buy and sell on the market &#x2026; it&#x2019;s about the externalisation of borders,&#x201D; she added.</p>
