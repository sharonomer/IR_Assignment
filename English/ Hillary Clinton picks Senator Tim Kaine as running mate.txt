<p>Hillary Clinton named Virginia Senator Tim Kaine as her vice presidential running mate on Friday, adding a centrist former governor of a crucial battleground state to the Democratic ticket.</p>
<p>In a text message to supporters, the presumptive Democratic nominee said, &#x201C;I&#x2019;m thrilled to tell you this first: I&#x2019;ve chosen Senator Tim Kaine as my running mate.&#x201D;</p>
<p>On Twitter a few seconds later, Clinton described Kaine as &#x201C;a man who&#x2019;s devoted his life to fighting for others&#x201D;.</p>

<p>She called him &#x201C;a relentless optimist who believes no problem is unsolvable if you put in the work to solve it&#x201D;.</p>
<p>Clinton&#x2019;s pick came a day after her opponent, Donald Trump, closed out the Republican Party&#x2019;s convention with a fiery address accusing her of &#x201C;terrible, terrible crimes&#x201D;.</p>
<h2>&#x2018;World-class senator&#x2019;</h2>
<p>Kaine, 58, had long been a favourite for Clinton&#x2019;s ticket. Fluent in Spanish and active in the Senate on foreign relations and military affairs, he built a reputation for working across the aisle as Virginia&#x2019;s governor and as mayor of Richmond.</p>
<p>In a recent interview with CBS News, Clinton noted that Kaine has never lost an election during his lengthy political career and praised him as a &#x201C;world-class mayor, governor and senator&#x201D;.</p>
<p>A favourite of Barack Obama since his early 2008 endorsement, the president told Clinton&#x2019;s campaign he believed Kaine would be a strong choice during the selection process, according to a Democratic familiar with the search who was not authorised to discuss it publicly.</p>
<p>Those views are not shared by some liberals in the Democratic Party, who dislike his support of free trade and Wall Street.</p>
<p>They pushed Clinton to pick Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren or Ohio Senator Sherrod Brown, intensifying their criticism of Kaine late this week as his selection appeared imminent.</p>
<p>Clinton&#x2019;s campaign largely declined to comment on the search process, trying to keep the details &#x2013; even the names of the finalists &#x2013; under wraps to try to maximise the impact of their announcement.</p>
<p>She made no mention of her impending pick during a sombre meeting on Friday with community leaders and family members affected by the Pulse nightclub shooting in Orlando and a later campaign rally in Tampa.</p>
<p>She is expected to campaign with Kaine on Saturday morning at an event in Miami.</p>
<h2>Centrist candidate</h2>
<p>Before entering politics, Kaine was an attorney who specialised in civil rights and fair housing. He learned Spanish during a mission trip to Honduras while in law school, an experience he still references on the campaign trail.</p>
<p>During his political career, he&#x2019;s demonstrated an ability to woo voters across party lines, winning his 2006 gubernatorial race with support in both Democratic and traditionally Republican strongholds.</p>
<p>His wife, Anne Holton, is the daughter of a former Virginia governor, a former state judge and, currently, the state&#x2019;s Education Secretary. The couple has three children.</p>
<p>Clinton&#x2019;s plans to pick Kaine, hinted at for several days leading up her Friday announcement, had been viewed as a safe choice against the Republican ticket of Trump and Indiana Governor Mike Pence.</p>
<p>Some Democrats believe Trump&#x2019;s selection of Pence, a conservative white man from a largely Republican state, freed Clinton from pressure to add another woman or minority to her ticket.</p>
<p>Her short list included Warren, two Latino cabinet secretaries and New Jersey Governor Cory Booker, one of two black US senators.</p>
<p>Democrats argue that Kaine could help her to woo moderate and even some Republican voters turned off by Trump&#x2019;s provocative rhetoric, which was at the centre of his 75-minute acceptance speech on Thursday night.</p>
<p>Kaine got some practice challenging Trump&#x2019;s message when he campaigned with Clinton last week in northern Virginia, where he spoke briefly in Spanish and offered a strident assault on Trump&#x2019;s White House credentials.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Do you want a &#x2018;you&#x2019;re fired&#x2019; president or a &#x2018;you&#x2019;re hired&#x2019; president?&#x201D; Kaine asked in Annandale, Virginia, as Clinton nodded. &#x201C;Do you want a trash-talking president or a bridge-building president?&#x201D;</p>
