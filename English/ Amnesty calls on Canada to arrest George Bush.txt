<p>Amnesty International has called on Canadian authorities to arrest and prosecute George W Bush, saying the former US president authorised torture in the course of the United States&#x2019; &#x201C;war on terror&#x201D;.</p>
<p>Bush is expected to attend an economic summit in Surrey in Canada&#x2019;s westernmost British Columbia province on October 20.</p>
<p>The human rights organisation&#xA0;said in a statement released&#xA0;on Wednesday that&#xA0;the Canadian government has &#x201C;international obligations &#x2026; given [Bush&#x2019;s] responsibility for crimes under international law including torture&#x201D;.</p>
<p>The London-based group also&#xA0;released a <a class="InternalLink" href="http://www.amnesty.org.uk/uploads/documents/doc_21963.pdf" target="_blank">27-page memorandum</a> that it had submitted in September to Canada&#x2019;s attorney general laying out its legal case.</p>
<p>&#x201C;As the US authorities have, so far, failed to bring former president Bush to justice, the international community must step in,&#x201D; said Susan Lee, Amnesty&#x2019;s Americas director, in the statement.</p>
<p>&#x201C;A failure by Canada to take action during his visit would violate the UN Convention against Torture and demonstrate contempt for fundamental human rights.&#x201D;</p>
<p>A spokesman for the Canadian government was not immediately available for comment.</p>
<p>Bush cancelled a visit to Switzerland in February after facing similar public calls for his arrest.</p>
<p><strong>&#x2018;Face justice&#x2019;</strong></p>
<p>Alex Neve, secretary general of Amnesty International&#x2019;s Canadian branch, told a&#xA0;news&#xA0;conference the rights group will pursue its case against the former US president with the governments of other countries he might visit.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Torturers must face justice, and their crimes are so egregious that the responsibility for ensuring justice is shared by all nations,&#x201D; Neve said. </p>
<p>&#x201C;Friend or foe, extraordinary or very ordinary times, most or least powerful nation, faced with concerns about terrorism or any other threat, torture must be stopped.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Amnesty, backed by the International Civil Liberties Monitoring Group, said Bush authorised the use of &#x201C;enhanced interrogation techniques&#x201D; and &#x201C;waterboarding&#x201D; on detainees held in secret by the Central Intelligence Agency between 2002 and 2009.</p>
<p>Bush himself has confirmed he authorised the waterboarding of several individuals.</p>
<p>The detention programme included &#x201C;torture and other cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment [such as being forced to stay for hours in painful positions and sleep deprivation], and enforced disappearances,&#x201D;&#xA0;Amnesty alleged.</p>
<p>Amnesty&#x2019;s memorandum relies on the public record, US documents obtained through access to information requests, Bush&#x2019;s own memoir and a report from the International Committee of the Red Cross critical of&#xA0;US counter terrorism policies.</p>
<p>The organisation&#xA0;cites several instances of alleged torture of detainees at the Guantanamo Bay naval facility, in Afghanistan and in Iraq, by the US military.</p>
<p>They include that of Zayn al Abidin Muhammed Husayn [known as Abu Zubaydah] and alleged&#xA0;September 11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, both arrested in Pakistan. </p>
<p>The two men were waterboarded 266 times between them from 2002 to 2003, according to the CIA inspector general, cited by Amnesty.</p>
