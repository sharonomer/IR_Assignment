<p>It had reported&#xA0;days earlier that Mubarak was suffering from &#x201C;chronic infections in the gallbladder&#x201D;.</p>
<p>The report was unusual as discussion of the president&#x2019;s health is usually a taboo subject in&#xA0;Egypt.</p>
<p><strong>&#x2018;Concern to many&#x2019;</strong></p>
<p>Samer Shehata, an Egyptian professor at Georgetown University, told Al Jazeera that since&#xA0;Egypt has no vice-president, news of Mubarak&#x2019;s surgery becomes &#x201C;a concern to many Egyptians and many outside the country if it does not go well&#x201D;.</p>

<p>&#x201C;Whenever there is a health issue with [the]&#xA0;president, all of a sudden questions of succession rise to the forefront of Egyptian politics, tremendous speculation, some concern and anxiety, and this is just one of those examples,&#x201D; he said.</p>
<p>Mubarak&#x2019;s fifth six-year term as president will end in 2011 and&#xA0;press reports in Egypt have suggested that his son Gamal is likely&#xA0;to succeed him.</p>
<p>Neither Mubarak nor his son have made any clear statements on the matter.</p>
<p>&#x201C;The succession issue is one of the most hotly contested issues in Egypt right now. For good reason, it&#x2019;s tied into the issue of democratisation and reform and so on,&#x201D; Shehata said.</p>
<p><strong>Succession concerns</strong></p>
<p>Rawya Rageh, Al Jazeera&#x2019;s correspondent in Cairo, said that both the &#x201C;timing and the announcement were significant&#x201D;.</p>
<p>&#x201C;This, of course, is an election year in Egypt. We&#x2019;re expecting parliamentary elections later this year&#xA0;followed by presidential elections in 2011,&#x201D; she said.</p>
<p>&#x201C;President Hosni Mubarak has, of course, never appointed a vice-president and the issue of succession has always loomed over his presidency.&#xA0;</p>
<p>&#x201C;All this comes at a time when the country is witnessing a heated political debate with the return of the former head of [the] IAEA, [Mohamed] ElBaradei, who has spoken a lot about reforms in Egypt; about the ability of independent candidates to run as presidential candidates for next year&#x2019;s election.&#x201D;</p>
<p>The IAEA is the UN&#x2019;s nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency and ElBaradei, its former head, has said he could stand for president, but only if certain constitutional changes are made.</p>
<p><strong>Health scare</strong></p>
<p>Mubarak has said that ElBaradei could run for the presidency, provided he respects the constitution.</p>
<p>Under Egyptian law, a presidential candidate is required to have been a leading member of a party for at least one year and for the party to have existed for at least five years.</p>
<p>ElBaradei, who established the National Association for Change after he returned to Cairo last month has proved popular among Egyptians and enjoys a high profile internationally.</p>
<p>Murbarak&#x2019;s health has been a concern&#xA0;in the past. In 2007,&#xA0;rumours about&#xA0;his poor&#xA0;health were&#xA0;rife to&#xA0;the extent that&#xA0;he was prompted&#xA0;to make an unscheduled public appearance to dispel them.</p>
<p>One year later, Ibrahim Eissa, the editor-in-chief of the independent daily a<em>l-Dustur</em>, was sentenced to two months in jail after his newspaper published rumours on Mubarak&#x2019;s health,&#xA0;although he was later granted a presidential pardon.</p>
