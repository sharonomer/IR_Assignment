<p>In his first interaction with the media since he was removed from power in February 2011, Hosni Mubarak,&#xA0;Egypt&#x2019;s former leader, has&#xA0;reportedly said&#xA0;President Mohamed Morsi faces a difficult job and it is too early to judge his performance.</p>
<p>Mubarak made the comments in an interview with the newspaper<em>&#xA0;El-Watan</em> on Saturday.The authenticity of the interview could not be immediately verified.</p>
<p>&#x201C;He is a new president who is carrying out weighty missions for the first time, and we shouldn&#x2019;t judge him now,&#x201D; Mubarak said.</p>
<p>The 85-year-old&#xA0;also said he was concerned about lax security, apparently referring to increased crime, and a rise in activity by armed groups in&#xA0;the Sinai Peninsula.</p>
<p><em>El-Watan</em>, which published the interview on Sunday, said its reporter broke through security lines to speak to Mubarak, <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2013/05/201351173415592499.html">who is facing a retrial </a>over charges of complicity in the death of protesters killed in the popular uprising that swept him from office.</p>
<p>Mubarak said: &#x201C;History will judge and I am still certain that the coming generations will view me fairly.&#x201D;</p>
<p>The former leader, who was president for almost 30 years, said he was saddened by what he described as the difficult conditions facing the poor and the Egyptian economy.</p>
<p>Hammered by political instability,&#xA0;the economy is in the doldrums and the government is in negotiations with the International Monetary Fund to secure a bailout loan.</p>
<p>&#x201C;This is the secret of my sadness: to see the poor in this condition,&#x201D; said Mubarak, who was toppled by an uprising fuelled in part by economic hardship.</p>
<p><strong>&#x2018;Fear for the country&#x2019;</strong></p>
<p>Mubarak&#xA0;said he was worried by the prospect of Egypt concluding an agreement with the IMF on a $4.8bn loan seen as vital to supporting the economy. The loan would bring austerity measures&#xA0;that could remove subsidy spending.</p>
<p>Economists fault the Mubarak-era subsidy&#xA0;government for failing to target state support at the most needy. The Morsi administration says it wants to better direct the subsidies.</p>
<p>Mubarak said the poor were at the heart of his decision-making, especially when it came to subsidy spending on staples.</p>
<p>&#x201C;I fear for the country because of the IMF loan,&#x201D; he said.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Its terms are very difficult, and represent a great danger to the Egyptian economy later on. This will then hit the poor citizen, and the low-income bracket,&#x201D; he said.</p>
<p>With parliamentary elections approaching later this year, the Morsi administration has yet to conclude an IMF deal.</p>
