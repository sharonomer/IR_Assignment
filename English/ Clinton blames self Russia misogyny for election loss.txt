<p><a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/topics/people/hillary-clinton.html">Hillary Clinton</a> has said that she is taking responsibility for her <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/topics/events/election-2016.html">2016 election</a> loss but believes misogyny, Russian interference and questionable decisions by the <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/topics/organisations/fbi.html">FBI</a> influenced the outcome.</p>
<p>The former Democratic presidential nominee offered extensive comments about the election during the Women for Women International&#x2019;s annual luncheon in New York on Tuesday.</p>
<p>She said she has been going through the &#x201C;painful&#x201D; process of reliving the 2016 contest while writing a book.</p>
<p>&#x201C;It wasn&#x2019;t a perfect campaign. There is no such thing,&#x201D; Clinton said in a question-and-answer session with CNN&#x2019;s Christiane Amanpour.</p>
<p>&#x201C;But I was on the way to winning, until a combination of [FBI Director] Jim Comey&#x2019;s letter on October 28 and Russian WikiLeaks raised doubts in the minds of people who were inclined to vote for me but got scared off.&#x201D;</p>
<p>On October 28, Comey sent a letter to Congress <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/10/fbi-clinton-emails-investigation-161028185242864.html">saying new emails</a> had turned up in the investigation looking into her use of a private server while she was secretary of state &#x2013; emails that later proved to be irrelevant.</p>
<p>&#x201C;If the election were on October 27, I would be your president,&#x201D; Clinton said.</p>
<p>Forecaster FiveThirtyEight said that just before Comey&#x2019;s announcement, she had an 81 percent chance of winning the election. Two days before the November 8 election, her chances were 65 percent, according to the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-much-did-comey-hurt-clintons-chances/" target="_blank">same forecast.</a>&#xA0;</p>
<h2><span style="font-size:1.5em">Russian hacking</span></h2>
<p>Clinton reminded the enthusiastic audience packed with women that she earned 3 million more votes than Republican <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/topics/people/donald-trump.html">Donald Trump</a>, who won more Electoral College votes and won the election.</p>
<p>She also said <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/russia.html">Russia</a> hacked into her campaign&#x2019;s internal emails and subsequently coordinated their release on WikiLeaks.</p>
<p>US intelligence agencies are investigating whether Russia coordinated with Trump associates to influence the election, something Russia has denied.</p>
<p>&#x201C;He [Russian President <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/topics/people/vladimir-putin.html">Vladimir Putin</a>] certainly interfered in our election,&#x201D; Clinton said. &#x201C;And it&#x2019;s clear he interfered to hurt me and help my opponent.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Political analyst Bill Schneider said that more than anything, Clinton herself was the reason the Democrats lost the election.</p>
<p>&#x201C;She&#x2019;s been around for over 25 years, that was her biggest problem in the election,&#x201D; he told Al Jazeera.</p>
<p>&#x201C;She is a charter member of the establishment, and 2016 was a very anti-establishment year.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Amanpour also asked Clinton whether she was a victim of misogyny.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Yes, I do think it played a role,&#x201D; she said, adding that misogyny is &#x201C;very much a part of the landscape politically, socially and economically&#x201D;.</p>
<p>After two unsuccessful presidential campaigns, Clinton is not expected to run for public office again.</p>
<p>&#x201C;I&#x2019;m now back to being an activist citizen and part of the resistance,&#x201D; she said.</p>
