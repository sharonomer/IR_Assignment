<p><span>President Donald Trump has denied seeing&#xA0;</span>a memo by a senior United States official warning of mass casualties and economic devastation from the new coronavirus, months before the pandemic began inflicting thousands of deaths in the US.&#xA0;</p>
<p>Trump on Tuesday said he had not seen communications sent by White House trade adviser Peter Navarro <span>in late January&#xA0;</span>warning of the serious threat posed by the coronavirus.</p>
<p>&#x201C;I read about it maybe a day, two days ago,&#x201D; Trump said when asked about the January 30 memo at a news conference. &#x201C;It was a recommendation that he had, I think he told certain people on the staff, but it didn&#x2019;t matter. I didn&#x2019;t see it.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Navarro, a China hawk, sent a memo on January 30 warning that the new coronavirus could create a pandemic and urging a travel ban for China, The New York Times <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/06/us/politics/navarro-warning-trump-coronavirus.html" target="_blank">reported</a>. A second memo, written in late February and sent to the president, said the virus could kill up to two million Americans.</p>
<p>&#x201C;The lack of immune protection or an existing cure or vaccine would leave Americans defenceless in the case of a full-blown coronavirus outbreak on US soil,&#x201D; said one of Navarro&#x2019;s messages.</p>
<p>&#x201C;This lack of protection elevates the risk of the coronavirus evolving into a full-blown pandemic, imperiling the lives of millions of Americans.&#x201D;</p>
<p>The US president continued to defend his actions in the early days of the crisis and played down Navarro&#x2019;s memos.</p>

<p>Navarro warned the coronavirus crisis could cost the US trillions of dollars and put millions of Americans at risk of illness or death.</p>
<h2><span>Report of earlier intel warnings</span></h2>
<p>Trump said he was not aware of the memos, but that he unilaterally followed some of their recommendations, including taking steps to curtail travel from China.</p>
<p>But he said he would not have wanted to act prematurely when it was not clear how dire the situation would become.</p>
<p>&#x201C;I don&#x2019;t want to create havoc and shock and everything else. I&#x2019;m not going to go out and start screaming, &#x2018;This could happen, this could happen&#x2019;,&#x201D; Trump said. &#x201C;I&#x2019;m a cheerleader for this country.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Trump also denied knowing about US intelligence warnings that were reportedly made as early as November about a contagion that had the potential to lead to a &#x201C;<span>cataclysmic event&#x201D;.&#xA0;</span></p>
<p>ABC News, citing two unnamed officials, <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/intelligence-report-warned-coronavirus-crisis-early-november-sources/story?id=70031273&amp;cid=clicksource_4380645_2_takeover_2_headlines_hed" target="_blank">reported</a> that multiple warnings were made late last year, including to the White House.&#xA0;</p>
<p>Asked about the report on Wednesday, Trump said he learned about the gravity of the crisis shortly before announcing travel restrictions on China on January 31.&#xA0;</p>
<p>Health experts have suggested the weekly death totals will reach a new high in the US this week. More than 14,500 people have died from the virus in the US so far, with about 424,000 confirmed infections.</p>
<p> Nearly 800 people died on Tuesday in New York state, the <a href="/news/2020/04/ny-records-731-coronavirus-deaths-deadliest-day-200407155210704.html?utm_source=website&amp;utm_medium=article_page&amp;utm_campaign=read_more_links?utm_source=website&amp;utm_medium=article_page&amp;utm_campaign=read_more_links">epicentre of the US crisis</a>.</p>
<h2>Guidelines &#x2018;disregarded&#x2019;</h2>
<p>Jeremy Konyndyk, a former Obama administration official who wrote guidance on health emergencies, said the memos clearly show Trump and his officials failed to take action on the threat of coronavirus.</p>
<p>He told Al Jazeera the emergency guidelines were specific on a fast-spreading respiratory disease and warned to &#x201C;trigger preparedness&#x201D;.</p>
<p>&#x201C;It listed a number of things that the administration should begin to do: diagnostic testing; ensuring the PPE [personal protective equipment] supply was sufficient; begin planning for mass-casualty events &#x2013; all of that was in there,&#x201D; said Konyndyk.</p>
<p>&#x201C;That was disregarded and I think it really isn&#x2019;t quite right to blame the WHO for our own lack of preparedness. If they would have followed that playbook, they would have begun kicking things into gear on January 30.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Former Vice President Joe Biden, a Democrat presidential candidate hopeful, blasted the US president&#x2019;s handling of the pandemic.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Coronavirus is not Donald Trump&#x2019;s fault. But he does bear responsibility for our response and taking his duties seriously,&#x201D; Biden said. &#x201C;His failings and his delays [are] causing real pain for so many Americans.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Trump should use his powers under federal law to ensure the production of protective gear for health workers, offer healthcare coverage to those who have lost it, and coordinate states&#x2019; efforts to procure supplies, Biden said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Trump likes to say he&#x2019;s a wartime president,&#x201D; Biden said. &#x201C;Well, he needs to step up and act like it.&#x201D;</p>
<p>For his part, Trump has&#xA0;<span>redoubled his&#xA0;</span><a href="/news/2020/04/trump-threatens-deny-funding-world-health-organization-200408012719572.html">criticism of the World Health Organization</a><span>&#xA0;for its handling of the virus and threatened to suspend US funding to the United Nations agency.&#xA0;</span></p>

<h2><strong>Watchdog removed</strong></h2>
<p>Trump also removed the inspector general (IG) who was to oversee the government&#x2019;s $2.3 trillion coronavirus response, a spokeswoman for the official&#x2019;s office said on Tuesday, raising concerns in Congress about oversight of the relief package.</p>
<p>It was the Republican president&#x2019;s most recent broadside against the federal watchdogs who seek to root out government waste, fraud, and abuse following his removal on Friday of the intelligence community&#x2019;s IG, and his sharp criticism of the one who oversees the US Department of Health and Human Services.</p>
<p>Glenn Fine, the acting <span>IG</span><span>&#xA0;of the&#xA0;</span>defence department, was named last week to chair a committee acting as a sort of uber-watchdog over the federal government&#x2019;s response to the coronavirus crisis, including health policy and the largest economic relief package in US history.</p>
<p>But Trump has since designated the Environmental Protection Agency&#x2019;s&#xA0;<span>IG</span> as the new acting Pentagon IG, a spokeswoman said.</p>
<p>Congressional Democrats said Fine&#x2019;s removal, less than a week after his appointment, reinforced their determination to strictly oversee the massive spending package passed last month to prop up the economy as the country grapples with the disease.</p>
<p>House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi called it &#x201C;part of a disturbing pattern of retaliation&#x201D; by Trump.</p>
<p>&#x201C;We will continue to exercise our oversight to ensure that this historic investment of taxpayer dollars is being used wisely and efficiently,&#x201D; she said in a statement.</p>
<p>Trump largely shrugged off a question about Fine&#x2019;s removal, saying it was his prerogative.</p>
<p>&#x201C;We have a lot of IGs in from the Obama era. And, as you know, it&#x2019;s a presidential decision,&#x201D; Trump told reporters.</p>
