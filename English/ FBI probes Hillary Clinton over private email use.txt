<p>A State Department review released in May faulted Clinton for her exclusive use of the private email server during her tenure as secretary of state from 2009 to 2013, saying the practice posed a security risk and did not comply with government records laws.</p>
<p>Republicans have highlighted the issue to raise questions about Clinton&#x2019;s trustworthiness and judgment, while Clinton has expressed regret over the email controversy.</p>
<p>Saturday&#x2019;s interview came just one day after Attorney General Loretta Lynch sought to reassure the public that the investigation would not be tainted by political bias after she met in private with Clinton&#x2019;s husband, former president Bill Clinton, earlier this week.</p>
<p>Lynch said that she would follow the recommendations of prosecutors who are examining whether Hillary Clinton violated any laws through her use of the private email system.She said that she had made the decision several months ago, before criticisms arose surrounding her meeting with Clinton&#x2019;s husband.</p>
<p>While Clinton failed to cooperate with a State Department inspector general&#x2019;s audit of her email practices that concluded she had failed comply with agency standards on record keepin, the candidate&#x2019;s campaign said she was fully cooperating with the FBI.</p>
