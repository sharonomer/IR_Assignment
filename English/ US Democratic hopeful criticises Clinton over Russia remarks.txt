<p>US Democratic presidential candidate Tulsi Gabbard has fired back at <a href="/topics/people/hillary-clinton.html">Hillary Clinton</a> after the former secretary of state&#xA0;appeared to call her &#x201C;the favourite of the Russians&#x201D; in the 2020 elections race.</p>
<p>&#x201C;I think they&#x2019;ve got their eye on somebody who&#x2019;s currently in the Democratic primary, and they&#x2019;re grooming her to be the third-party candidate,&#x201D; Clinton said on the Campaign HQ podcast that first aired on Thursday.</p>
<p>&#x201C;She&#x2019;s the favourite of the Russians. They have a bunch of sites and bots and other ways of supporting her so far.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Clinton, the 2016 Democratic presidential candidate, did not name Gabbard directly, but the Hawaii congresswoman essentially acknowledged she was the target by blasting out a stunning Twitter thread against the former first lady on Friday.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">&#x2026; concerted campaign to destroy my reputation. We wondered who was behind it and why. Now we know &#x2014; it was always you, through your proxies and &#x2026;</p>

<p>&#x201C;Great! Thank you @HillaryClinton. You, the queen of warmongers, embodiment of corruption, and personification of the rot that has sickened the Democratic Party for so long, have finally come out from behind the curtain,&#x201D; Gabbard tweeted at her fellow Democrat.</p>

<p>Gabbard, 38, accused 71-year-old Clinton, long a doyenne of the Washington establishment, of leading a &#x201C;concerted campaign&#x201D; to destroy her reputation since she announced her presidential run in January.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Now we know &#x2013; it was always you, through your proxies and powerful allies in the corporate media and war machine, afraid of the threat I pose,&#x201D; she added.</p>

<p>&#x201C;It&#x2019;s now clear that this primary is between you and me,&#x201D; she continued. &#x201C;Don&#x2019;t cowardly hide behind your proxies. Join the race directly.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Clinton has <a href="/news/2019/03/hillary-clinton-rules-2020-presidential-run-190305061846774.html">said she is done running for president</a>.</p>
<p>In the 2016 presidential election, Clinton won the popular vote with a margin of some three million votes but lost to <a href="/topics/people/donald-trump.html">Donald Trump</a> through the electoral college vote, which went in the Republican candidate&#x2019;s favour with 304 to Clinton&#x2019;s 227.</p>
<h2><strong>&#x2018;Trump is Putin&#x2019;s dream&#x2019;</strong></h2>
<p>There is lingering trepidation in the Democratic Party of a repeat of the 2016 presidential race, when <a href="/topics/country/Russia.html">Russia</a> interfered in the polls in an effort to help Trump defeat Clinton.</p>
<p>US intelligence agencies have warned that Russia intends to meddle in the <a href="/topics/events/190521190729601.html">2020 presidential election</a>, as well.</p>
<p>Russian President <a href="/topics/people/vladimir-putin.html">Vladimir Putin</a> has mocked that possibility, joking earlier this month that Moscow would &#x201C;definitely intervene&#x201D; again.</p>

<p>During a Democratic presidential debate on Tuesday, Gabbard criticised a TV commentator who she said had called her &#x201C;an asset of Russia&#x201D;. She called the comments &#x201C;completely despicable&#x201D;.</p>
<p>Without naming Gabbard, Clinton seemed to echo the commentator&#x2019;s remark during a podcast appearance this week on Campaign HQ with David Plouffe. Plouffe was campaign manager for President <a href="/topics/people/barack-obama.html">Barack Obama</a> in 2008 and served as a senior adviser to the president.</p>
<p>Clinton also called Trump &#x201C;Vladimir Putin&#x2019;s dream&#x201D; in the interview. She went on to say that Trump&#x2019;s inauguration speech was &#x201C;like a declaration of war on half of America&#x201D;.</p>
<p>The former US top diplomat also described 2016 Green Party presidential candidate Jill Stein as &#x201C;a Russian asset&#x201D;.</p>
<p>The Russians know they cannot win without a third-party candidate, Clinton added.</p>
<p>US Special Counsel <a href="/topics/spotlight/mueller-probe.html">Robert Mueller</a>, who was investigating Russian meddling in the 2016 US presidential elections, wrapped up his <a href="/news/2019/04/trump-declares-victory-russia-rejects-mueller-report-190419075537484.html">report</a> earlier this year, concluding that Moscow did interfere in the polls to help boost Trump&#x2019;s chances of victory.</p>
<p>But the investigation could not find evidence of a criminal conspiracy between Trump&#x2019;s election campaign and Russia.</p>
<p>Clinton said it was clear Russia is laying the groundwork for similar interference in 2020.</p>
