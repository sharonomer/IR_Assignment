<p>United States President-elect Joe Biden has been formally given the go-ahead by a federal agency to begin his transition to the presidency, shortly after the battleground state of Michigan certified him as the winner there.</p>
<p>With the rapid-fire developments on Monday, President Donald Trump&#x2019;s already languishing efforts to overturn his November 3 defeat appeared to be coming to a close.</p>
<p>The US General Services Administration (GSA), an independent agency, ascertained that Biden was the &#x201C;apparent winner&#x201D; of the election and informed Biden that his transition &#x2013; leading up to a January 20 swearing-in &#x2013; could officially begin.</p>
<p>GSA Administrator Emily Murphy made the determination after Trump&#x2019;s efforts to challenge the vote failed across battleground states, citing &#x201C;recent developments involving legal challenges and certifications of election results&#x201D;.</p>
<p>Michigan certified Biden&#x2019;s victory Monday, and a federal judge in Pennsylvania moved on Saturday to throw out a Trump campaign lawsuit seeking to prevent certification in that state.</p>
<p>Murphy, a Trump appointee, has faced bipartisan criticism for failing to begin the transition process sooner, preventing Biden&#x2019;s team from working with agency officials on plans for his administration, including in critical national security and public health areas.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Please know that I came to my decision independently, based on the law and available facts. I was never directly or indirectly pressured by any Executive Branch official &#x2013; including those who work at the White House or GSA &#x2013; with regard to the substance or timing of my decision,&#x201D; Murphy wrote in a letter to Biden.</p>
<h2>&#x2018;Lost time&#x2019;</h2>
<p>Yohannes Abraham, the Biden-Harris Transition Executive Director, said the decision was a &#x201C;definitive administrative action&#x201D; that would formally begin the transition process with federal agencies.</p>
<p>&#x201C;In the days ahead, transition officials will begin meeting with federal officials to discuss the [coronavirus] pandemic response, have a full accounting of our national security interests, and gain complete understanding of the Trump administration&#x2019;s efforts to hollow out government agencies.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Thurgood Marshall Jr, a former Clinton Cabinet Secretary, told Al Jazeera that the delay had been &#x201C;unconscionable&#x201D; especially at a time when the United States was facing an accelerating COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>&#x201C;It will make a tremendous difference (to Biden) with regard to the fast-moving developments with the pandemic and getting a vaccine out to the public,&#x201D; Thurgood said. &#x201C;That process vitally important within the United States and globally can now move forward in a much more organised and sensible fashion.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Biden will also need to make thousands of appointments &#x2013; some of which will require confirmation hearings &#x2013; while federal agencies will also need to adjust their priorities to the incoming administration, he added.</p>
<p>&#x201C;They will have to make up for lost time,&#x201D; Thurgood said. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s going to be a lot of hard work in the coming weeks.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Trump, who had refused to concede the election, said in a tweet that he was directing his team to cooperate on the transition but is vowing to keep up the fight.</p>
<p>In a tweet, Trump wrote that Murphy and her team should &#x201C;do what needs to be done with regard to initial protocols, and have told my team to do the same&#x201D;.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">&#x2026;fight, and I believe we will prevail! Nevertheless, in the best interest of our Country, I am recommending that Emily and her team do what needs to be done with regard to initial protocols, and have told my team to do the same.</p>

<p>Separately, retiring Tennessee Republican Senator Lamar Alexander, who has repeatedly called for the transition to begin, released a statement Monday saying that Trump should &#x201C;put the country first&#x201D; and help Biden&#x2019;s administration succeed.</p>
<p>&#x201C;When you are in public life, people remember the last thing you do,&#x201D; Alexander said.</p>
