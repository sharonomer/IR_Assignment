<p><a href="/topics/country/egypt.html">Egypt</a>&#xA0;will hold a three-day referendum starting on Saturday over proposed constitutional changes that could allow President&#xA0;<a href="/topics/people/abdel-fattah-el-sisi.html">Abdel Fattah&#xA0;el-Sisi</a>&#xA0;to stay in power until 2030.</p>
<p>The ballot will run between April 20-22 and will also see voters decide on whether an upper parliamentary chamber should be created, Lasheen Ibrahim, the chairman of the National Election Authority, said in a statement on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The announcement came a day after Egypt&#x2019;s parliament <a href="/news/2019/04/egypt-mps-pass-amendments-extend-abdel-fattah-el-sisi-rule-190416171839802.html">passed</a> the proposed amendments, signing off on potentially extending Sisi&#x2019;s tenure until 2030 by permitting the&#xA0;general-turned-president to extend his current mandate by two years until 2024, and then stand for another six-year term.</p>
<p><span><span>The 596-member assembly is packed with el-Sisi supporters, with 531 of the 554 legislators who attended the vote opting in favour of the constitutional changes.</span></span></p>
<p><span>But critics have decried the proposals as another step back to authoritarianism, eight years after a pro-democracy uprising put an end to&#xA0;</span><a href="/focus/2009/12/200912693048491779.html">Hosni Mubarak</a><span>&#x2018;s three-decade rule.</span></p>
<h2>&#x2018;Contempt for Egyptians&#x2019; rights&#x2019;</h2>
<p><span>Sisi&#x2019;s government has been repeatedly criticised by <a href="/topics/categories/human_rights.html">human rights</a> organisations for alleged repression of political opponents.</span></p>
<p>In a statement on Tuesday, Amnesty International&#xA0;<a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2019/04/egypt-parliaments-approval-of-constitutional-amendments-demonstrates-their-complete-disregard-for-human-rights/" target="_blank">said</a>&#xA0;the proposed constitutional amendments would &#x201C;facilitate the authorities&#x2019; crackdown on freedom of expression, association and assembly, erode people&#x2019;s rights, and exacerbate the human rights crisis in the country&#x201D;.</p>
<p>&#x201C;The decision to put these amendments to the constitution to a public referendum, amid the worst crackdown on freedom of expression and severe restrictions on political parties and independent media, demonstrates the Egyptian government&#x2019;s contempt for the rights of all people in Egypt,&#x201D;&#xA0;said Magdalena Mughrabi, Amnesty&#x2019;s deputy Middle East and North Africa director.</p>
<p><span>Sisi himself won power in a 2014 ballot after leading a military coup the year before to depose his&#xA0;<span>democratically elected&#xA0;predecessor, President&#xA0;</span><a href="/news/2016/06/profile-egypt-deposed-president-mohamed-morsi-160607074148919.html">Mohamed Morsi</a><span>, of the now-outlawed&#xA0;</span><a href="/indepth/features/2017/06/muslim-brotherhood-explained-170608091709865.html">Muslim Brotherhood</a><span>&#xA0;movement.</span>&#xA0;</span></p>
<p>The 64-year-old was re-elected in March 2018 with more than 97 percent of the vote,&#xA0;<span>in a ballot boycotted by large swaths of the country&#x2019;s political opposition after several potential candidates dropped out citing intimidation or were arrested.</span></p>
<p>Only one other candidate, himself an ardent Sisi supporter, opposed the incumbent.&#xA0;Mousa Mostafa Mousa&#xA0;had endorsed Sisi for a second term and even organised events to help nominate the former military commander up until a week before the nomination deadline.</p>
<p><span>The election commission said last year&#x2019;s vote was held according to the &#x201C;highest international standards of integrity and transparency&#x201D;, but rights groups including international NGO Human Rights Watch <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2018/02/13/egypt-planned-presidential-vote-neither-free-nor-fair" target="_blank">slammed</a> the ballot as </span>neither &#x201C;free nor fair&#x201D;.</p>
