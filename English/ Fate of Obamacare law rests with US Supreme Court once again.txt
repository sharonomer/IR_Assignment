<p>The conservative-majority US <a href="/news/2020/6/26/trump-administration-asks-scotus-to-end-obamacare-amid-pandemic">Supreme Court</a> on Tuesday dives back into politically perilous waters as it hears arguments over a Republican challenge backed by President Donald Trump&#x2019;s administration aiming to invalidate the <a href="/features/2020/11/9/what-is-at-stake-when-the-us-supreme-court-takes-on-obamacare">Obamacare</a> healthcare law.</p>
<p>President-elect Joe Biden has criticised Republican efforts to throw out the Affordable Care Act (ACA), as the law is formally known, in the midst of a deadly coronavirus pandemic and hopes to buttress Obamacare after taking office on January 20.</p>
<p>The case represents the latest Republican legal attack on the 2010&#xA0;law, which was the signature <a href="/news/2020/3/2/us-supreme-court-will-hear-democratic-bid-to-defend-obamacare">domestic policy achievement</a> of Democratic former President Barack Obama, under whom Biden served as vice president.</p>

<p>The Supreme Court has a 6-3 conservative majority after the Republican-led Senate last month confirmed US President Donald Trump&#x2019;s third appointee, <a href="/news/2020/9/26/who-is-amy-coney-barrett-trumps-nominee-to-supreme-court">Amy Coney Barrett</a>. Most legal experts think the justices will stop short of a seismic ruling striking down&#xA0;<a href="/news/2019/12/19/us-court-part-of-obamacare-invalid-more-review-needed">Obamacare</a>. The&#xA0;Supreme&#xA0;Court&#xA0;in 2012 and 2015 fended off previous Republican challenges to it.</p>
<p>President-elect Joe Biden is scheduled to deliver a speech on the Affordable Care Act (ACA) on Tuesday.</p>
<p>His speech reflects the importance he is putting on healthcare as he prepares to take office in January amid the worst pandemic in more than a century. He is launching his transition process this week as the coronavirus surges across the country. The US surpassed 10 million cases on Monday.</p>
<p>Republican-governed states led by Texas, later backed by Trump&#x2019;s administration, sued in 2018 in Texas to strike down the&#xA0;law. The justices are due to hear 80 minutes of arguments by teleconference in an appeal by a coalition of Democratic-led states including California and New York and the Democratic-led House of Representatives to preserve&#xA0;Obamacare.</p>

Obamacare expanded public healthcare programmes and created marketplaces for private insurance.<p></p>
<p>&#x201C;We believe there are nine justices who connect the dots and see how important this is,&#x201D; said California Attorney General Xavier Becerra, a Democrat who is leading the coalition of 20 states defending&#xA0;Obamacare.</p>
<p>&#x201C;We think there&#x2019;s a very strong chance that Americans will continue to have good healthcare coverage,&#x201D; Becerra added.</p>

<p>The New Orleans-based 5th US Circuit Court of Appeals last year partially upheld that ruling, saying the law&#x2019;s &#x201C;individual mandate&#x201D;, which required people to obtain insurance or pay a financial penalty, afoul of the Constitution. But the 5th Circuit stopped short of striking down the law. The Democratic-led states and the House then appealed to the Supreme Court.</p>
<p>The 2012&#xA0;Supreme&#xA0;Court&#xA0;ruling upheld most&#xA0;Obamacare&#xA0;provisions including the individual mandate. The&#xA0;court&#xA0;defined this penalty as a tax and thus found the&#xA0;law&#xA0;permissible under the Constitution&#x2019;s provision empowering Congress to levy taxes.</p>
<p>In 2017, Trump signed a&#xA0;law&#xA0;that eliminated the financial penalty under the individual mandate, which gave rise to the Republican&#xA0;lawsuit. With that change, the individual mandate could no longer be interpreted as a tax provision and was therefore unlawful, the Republican challengers argued.</p>
