<div style="FONT-SIZE:10pt;FONT-FAMILY:Verdana">Egypt&#x2019;s MENA news agency quoted a source close to the family as saying Marwan had recently suffered from balance problems because of an illness and had been using a cane.</div>

<div style="FONT-SIZE:10pt;FONT-FAMILY:Verdana">Marwan had been living in London after leaving Egyptian government service late in the 1970s.</div>
<div style="FONT-SIZE:10pt;FONT-FAMILY:Verdana">&#xA0;</div>
<div style="FONT-SIZE:10pt;FONT-FAMILY:Verdana">He is thought to have feared for his life after he was publicly accused of being a spy for Mossad three years ago.</div>

<div style="FONT-SIZE:10pt;FONT-FAMILY:Verdana">Israeli media named his as a source for the Israeli secret service, saying he had passed a warning to Mossad, the Israeli intelligence agency, on the eve of the 1973 Middle East war, also called the Yom Kippur War.</div>

<div style="FONT-SIZE:10pt;FONT-FAMILY:Verdana">He worked as a senior information official for both Abdel Nasser and Anwar Sadat, Abdel Nasser&#x2019;s successor as president.</div>
