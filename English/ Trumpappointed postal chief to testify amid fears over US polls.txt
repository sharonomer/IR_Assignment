<p><span lang="EN-GB">President Donald Trump&#x2019;s appointed postmaster general has agreed to testify before US Congress next week on cuts in service that legislators fear could hamper the Postal Service&#x2019;s ability to handle a flood of mail-in ballots in <a href="/topics/events/us-election-2020.html">November&#x2019;s election</a>.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB">Postmaster General Louis DeJoy, a major Trump political donor, agreed to testify next Monday before the Democratic-led House of Representatives Oversight and Reform Committee, which is investigating whether service changes adopted in recent weeks have slowed mail deliveries.</span></p>
<p>The committee called DeJoy&#x2019;s appearance voluntary. Robert Duncan, who chairs the Postal Service board of governors and is a former chairman of the Republican National Committee, will testify along with DeJoy, the Postal Service confirmed.</p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB">Congressional Democrats have raised concerns that, amid a coronavirus pandemic that is expected to result in about twice as many Americans voting by mail as did so in 2016, cost-cutting at the Postal Service could lead to <a href="/news/2020/08/postal-service-significant-risk-late-election-ballots-200814203936634.html">missed or delayed ballots</a>.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB">They have pointed to reductions in overtime, restrictions on extra mail transportation trips and new mail sorting and delivery policies as changes that threaten to slow mail delivery.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB">Trump has repeatedly, and without evidence, claimed that mail balloting is vulnerable to fraud. Voting by mail is nothing new in the US, and one in four voters cast a ballot that way in 2016.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB">Separately, House Democratic Conference Chairman Hakeem Jeffries and Representative Ted Lieu called on the FBI to open a criminal probe into DeJoy.</span></p>

<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Dear <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@realDonaldTrump</a>: The House agrees that we need to save the post office. That&#x2019;s why we are coming back for emergency session this Saturday to pass legislation to stop the sabotage of USPS by you &amp;  Postmaster General DeJoy. We look forward to you signing the legislation. <a href="https://t.co/sBnJWFOXps">https://t.co/sBnJWFOXps</a></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB">&#x201C;There is evidence that making mail-in balloting more difficult may be one of the motivations for the changes instituted at the Post Office,&#x201D; Jeffries and Lieu wrote in a letter to FBI Director Christopher Wray.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB">&#x201C;There is also evidence that the Postmaster General has a financial stake in multiple financial entities that are either competitors to or contractors for the Post Office,&#x201D; the legislators said.</span></p>
<p>&#x201C;No, we&#x2019;re not tampering,&#x201D; Trump said in an interview with Fox News amid an outcry from Democrats and other critics who accuse him of trying to hamstring the Postal Service to suppress mail-in voting as he trails Democratic presidential challenger Joe Biden in polls before the November 3 election.</p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB">&#x201C;We want to make it run efficiently, run good,&#x201D; Trump said of the Postal Service.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB">Later on Monday, at an event in Oshkosh, Wisconsin, Trump said: &#x201C;We can&#x2019;t play games, get out and vote through those beautiful absentee ballots or just make sure your vote gets counted.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB">&#x201C;Make sure, because the only way we&#x2019;re going to lose this election is if the election is rigged. Remember that. The only way we&#x2019;re going to lose this election. So, we have to be very careful,&#x201D; he said.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB">Republican Senator Tom Cotton, a close Trump ally, accused Democrats of promoting &#x201C;conspiracy&#x201D; theories, a charge echoed by House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB">Trump, who himself plans to cast an absentee ballot by mail in Florida, and many other Republicans have opposed an expansion of mail-in voting to accommodate people concerned about going to the polls to vote in-person due to fears amid the pandemic.</span></p>

<p>Trump said in March that with mail-in voting at levels that Democrats were seeking, &#x201C;you&#x2019;d never have a Republican elected in this country again.&#x201D;</p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB">The Democratic-controlled House will meet on Saturday to consider legislation prohibiting changes to Postal Service levels that were in place on January 1, 2020, said the chamber&#x2019;s number two Democrat, Majority Leader Steny Hoyer.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB">A Democratic congressional aide said the legislation would also include $25bn in funding for the Postal Service. Congressional Democrats had sought that amount in talks on coronavirus relief legislation that broke down more than a week ago.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB">While Trump has voiced opposition to such funding, White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows said Monday the administration could agree to Postal Service funding as part of a bill to deliver coronavirus aid.</span></p>
