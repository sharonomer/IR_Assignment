<p>A man has set himself on fire in central Cairo&#x2019;s Tahrir Square and was being treated for burns at a hospital in the capital, security sources said.</p>
<p>There was no immediate official comment on the incident that happened on Thurday.</p>
<p>Videos circulating on social media appeared to show Mohammed Hosni filming himself as he walked along the street and then in the square &#x2013; the epicentre of Egypt&#x2019;s 2011 revolution &#x2013; complaining about alleged corruption in the country.</p>
<p>Dressed in a suit and tie, he started shouting before setting fire to his clothes at the end of the 20-minute video which he broadcast live on Facebook.</p>

<p>&#x201C;People of my country, the richest country in the world, the best country in the world &#x2026; it&#x2019;s held by thieves,&#x201D; he could be heard yelling in the video.</p>
<p>&#x201C;They are all corrupt, all of them are thieves,&#x201D; he said, referring to the country&#x2019;s ruling elite.</p>
<p>Another video taken from a balcony overlooking the square showed security guards and bystanders rushing to put out the flames with water and loose clothes.</p>

<p>Al Jazeera could not independently verify the videos.</p>
<p>The security officer, who could not be named, alleged that Hosni had been recently released from jail for criminal cases, but gave no further details.</p>
<p>A source from Cairo&#x2019;s security directorate said Hosni was under guard at a local hospital, where he had told officials that he worked at Egypt&#x2019;s Central Auditing Organisation.</p>
<p>The security officer accused the outlawed Muslim Brotherhood of exploiting Hosni. In the video, however, Hosni said he was not a Brotherhood member.</p>
<p>Authorities have arrested thousands of Muslim Brotherhood members since the 2013 military overthrow of late President Mohamed Morsi.</p>
<p>The group has consistently denied any link to violence, but Egypt&#x2019;s authorities call it a &#x201C;terrorist&#x201D; organisation.</p>
<p>&#x201C;The terrorist Muslim Brotherhood is exploiting one of its psychologically troubled members, forcing him to burn his clothes in an effort to foment chaos,&#x201D; the security source said.</p>
<p>Security in Tahrir Square, home to the mass demonstrations that toppled former longtime President Hosni Mubarak in 2011, is closely monitored.</p>
<p>Authorities have clamped down on public acts of protest amid a crackdown on civil society and free speech under President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, who took power in 2013 following Morsi&#x2019;s overthrow.</p>
<p>Egypt has been under a renewable state of emergency since 2017, a measure that rights groups say has allowed the government to crush dissent.</p>
<p>Scores of outspoken Egyptians have either been exiled or imprisoned in the past years, including prominent activists, lawyers and journalists.</p>
