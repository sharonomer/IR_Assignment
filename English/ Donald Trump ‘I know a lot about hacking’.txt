<p>President-elect Donald Trump says he is knowledgeable in the field of cyber-hacking and &#x201C;no computer is safe&#x201D; when it comes to keeping information private.</p>
<p><span>Trump&#x2019;s statement&#xA0;<span>to reporters during his annual New Year&#x2019;s Eve bash&#xA0;</span><span>expressed new scepticism about the security of online methods of communication his administration is set to use.</span></span></p>
<p>&#x201C;You know, if you have something really important, write it out and have it delivered by courier, the old-fashioned way &#x2026; because I&#x2019;ll tell you what: no computer is safe,&#x201D; Trump said.</p>
<p>The billionaire businessman has repeatedly <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/12/trump-pushes-russia-hacking-investigation-161210171247837.html">cast aside allegations</a> by US intelligence agencies that Russia tried to influence the presidential election through hacking.</p>
<p>President Barack Obama <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/12/expels-35-russian-diplomats-cyber-attacks-161229192854580.html">ordered sanctions</a> on Russian spy agencies last week, closed two Russian compounds, and expelled 35 diplomats the US alleged were really spies. The Russian government has denied the allegations.</p>

<hr>
<p>Trump plans to meet intelligence officials in the coming days to learn more about the allegations. He said he wants US officials &#x201C;to be sure, because it&#x2019;s a pretty serious charge&#x201D;. He pointed to intelligence failures over the existence of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq before the US invasion.</p>
<p>And the 70-year-old president-elect declared himself well-versed in the field of hacking.</p>
<p>&#x201C;I know a lot about hacking,&#x201D; he said, &#x201C;and hacking is a very hard thing to prove, so it could be somebody else.&#x201D;</p>
<p>He added cryptically that he also knows &#x201C;things that other people don&#x2019;t know. And so, they cannot be sure of the situation&#x201D;.</p>
<p>While Trump may be against computers, he&#x2019;s still planning lots of Twitter use.</p>
<p>When an ABC News interviewer asked whether Trump would continue his highly unusual &#x2013; and deeply controversial &#x2013; approach of making major policy statements over Twitter, his communications director Sean Spicer replied, &#x201C;Sure, why not?&#x201D;</p>
<p>With all due respect,&#x201D; he continued, &#x201C;I think it freaks the mainstream media out that he has this following of over 45-plus million people that follow him on social media, that he can have a direct conversation.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Spicer added: &#x201C;Business, as usual, is over &#x2026; There&#x2019;s a new sheriff in town.&#x201D;</p>
