<p><span>Lawyers for the family of Egypt&#x2019;s ex-president Mohamed Morsi&#xA0;said they obtained information showing his youngest son was killed by &#x201C;a lethal substance&#x201D; and not a heart attack as authorities earlier claimed.</span></p>
<p>Abdullah Morsi, 25, died a year ago on September 4 in a hospital in Giza, southwest of the Egyptian capital Cairo.</p>
<p>A government report at the time said Abdullah was driving his car when he had sudden spasms, and he was immediately taken to a hospital, but doctors were unable to revive him.</p>
<p>Several local news sites reported the death saying there was no criminal suspicion, while noting Morsi&#x2019;s son had suffered several previous health scares, and that he was saddened by his father&#x2019;s recent death.</p>
<p>Mohamed Morsi, Egypt&#x2019;s first democratically elected president,&#xA0;<a href="/news/2019/06/egypt-president-mohamed-morsi-dies-state-media-190617155322012.html">died on June 17</a>, 2019, after years in prison while awaiting trial on charges that he and legal observers said were politically motivated.</p>
<p>He was deposed in a 2013 military coup carried out by current President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi&#xA0;following a year in power.</p>

<p><span>Morsi&#x2019;s legal team at Guernica 37 International Justice Chambers announced on Sunday they obtained information that Abduallh had in fact been killed.</span></p>
<p><span>&#x201C;Information now disclosed appears to confirm that Abdullah was transported in his car a distance of more than 20km [12 miles] to a hospital after he took his last breath, as a result of having been injected with a lethal substance &#x2013; and he was not transferred to nearby hospitals, intentionally, until after he had died,&#x201D; a&#xA0;<a href="https://www.guernica37.com/post/press-statement-on-the-anniversary-of-the-death-of-abdullah-morsi" target="_blank"><span>statement</span></a>&#xA0;by the London-based law firm&#xA0;said.</span></p>
<p><span>&#x201C;It is quite clear that certain elements of the state were aware of this fact that is only now coming to light.&#x201D;</span></p>
<h2><strong>&#x2018;Assassination of the martyr&#x2019;</strong></h2>
<p>Toby Cadman, who heads the&#xA0;Guernica 37 legal team, <a href="https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/egypt-morsi-son-killed-lethal-substance-lawyers">told</a> the Middle East Eye the circumstances surrounding the death were &#x201C;mysterious&#x201D; and Abdullah had&#xA0;lived in fear for his life after publicly accusing some government officials of killing his father.</p>
<p><span>Over <span><a href="https://twitter.com/Abdullah_Morsi/status/1141713455881367552?s=20">Twitter</a>,&#xA0;</span>Abdullah&#xA0;</span><span>named </span><span>several individuals &#x2013; including current Interior Minister Mahmoud Tawfiq and Mohamed Shereen Fahmy, the judge who oversaw the Morsi&#x2019;s trial &#x2013; as &#x201C;accomplices&#x201D; in the &#x201C;assassination of the martyr, President Morsi&#x201D;.</span></p>
<p><span>Morsi&#x2019;s legal team said the Egyptian Public Prosecution later charged a 36-year-old woman named Randa Ali Shaker Ali Asran with premeditated murder over Abdullah Morsi&#x2019;s death.</span></p>
<p><span>The lawyers said Asran has not faced a transparent investigation.&#xA0;</span></p>
<p><span>Cadman&#x2019;s legal team concluded Abdullah did not die of a heart attack, but </span><span>was killed outside his home on September 4, 2019.&#xA0;</span></p>
<p><span>The lawyers accused &#x201C;certain elements of the state&#x201D; of being aware of the fact that Abdullah&#xA0;had been killed, and called for an independent investigation into the alleged murder.</span></p>
