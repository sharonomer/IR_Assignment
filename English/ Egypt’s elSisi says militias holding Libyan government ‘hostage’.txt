<p><a class="InternalLink" href="/topics/country/libya.html">Libya</a>&#x2018;s UN-supported government has been held hostage by &#x201C;terrorist militias&#x201D; in the capital, Tripoli, Egypt&#x2019;s leader <a class="InternalLink" href="/topics/people/abdel-fattah-el-sisi.html">Abdel Fattah el-Sisi</a>&#xA0;has said.</p>
<p>The comments came as the Libyan army denied reports of the imminent fall of Tripoli to forces led by renegade commander <a href="/topics/people/khalifa-haftar.html">Khalifa Haftar.</a></p>
<p>President el-Sisi&#xA0;said in televised comments on Sunday the internationally recognised Government of National Accord (GNA) &#x201C;is not able to have a free and real will because they have been taken hostage&#x201D;.</p>
<p>He did not elaborate and there was no immediate comment from the Tripoli authorities.</p>
<p>El-Sisi said the Libyan conflict posed a threat to Egypt&#x2019;s national security because fighters and weapons spill over the border into Egypt. He said Cairo had a right to interfere in Libya &#x201C;but did not take this step to maintain the relationship and brotherhood with the Libyan people&#x201D;.&#xA0;</p>
<p><span>Haftar&#x2019;s Libyan National Army (LNA), which supports a rival government in the country&#x2019;s east, has besieged the capital since April, vowing to oust the GNA from power.</span></p>
<p>Libya descended into chaos after the 2011 civil war involving NATO air strikes ousted and killed longtime ruler&#xA0;<a class="InternalLink" href="/topics/people/muammar-gaddafi.html">Muammar Gaddafi</a>.</p>
<h2>&#x2018;Situation.. is still in our favour&#x2019;&#xA0;</h2>
<p>On Monday, the Libyan army denied recent media reports that Tripoli could soon fall into the hands of Haftar&#x2019;s forces.</p>
<p>Haftar<a class="InternalLink" href="/news/2019/12/libya-haftar-announces-decisive-battle-capture-tripoli-191212205130743.html"> announced</a> the &#x201C;zero hour&#x201D; was near for the UN-backed government last week, and said a &#x201C;total assault was expected&#xA0;<span>by every free and honest Libyan&#x201D;.</span></p>
<p class="speakable">But GNA&#xA0;<span>military spokesman</span> Mohamed Qanunu told Anadolu&#xA0;<span>news agency</span> &#x201C;the situation on the ground is still in our favour&#x201D;.&#xA0;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Civilians, however, are suffering as a result of air bombardment by the war criminal Haftar,&#x201D;&#xA0;<span>Qanunu said, accusing the general&#xA0;</span>of using mercenaries from Africa and Russia in his attacks on Tripoli.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Atrocities have been committed against civilians in Tripoli and its outskirts in recent months,&#x201D; he added.</p>
<p>Last month, Turkey and the GNA reached deals on military cooperation and the maritime boundaries of countries in the Eastern Mediterranean.</p>
<p>Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan reiterated on Sunday that Ankara would send troops to Libya if the GNA made such a request.</p>
<p><span>&#x201C;We are more than ready to give whatever support is necessary to Libya,&#x201D;&#xA0;<span>Erdogan said on A Haber TV.</span></span></p>
<p>According to the agreement, Tripoli could request vehicles, equipment and weapons for use in army, navy and air operations. It also makes a provision for new intelligence sharing.</p>
