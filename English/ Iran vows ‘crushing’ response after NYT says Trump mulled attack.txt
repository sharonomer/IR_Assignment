<p>Any attack by the United States against Iran would face a &#x201C;crushing&#x201D; response, an Iranian government spokesman has said, following a report that President Donald Trump last week asked for options for attacking Iran&#x2019;s main nuclear site.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Any action against the Iranian nation would certainly face a crushing response,&#x201D; Ali Rabiei said on Tuesday in remarks streamed on an official government website, according to the Reuters news agency.</p>
<p>On Monday, the New York Times <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/16/us/politics/trump-iran-nuclear.html">reported</a> that Trump had asked his close aides what &#x201C;options were available&#x201D; to take action against Iran&#x2019;s key nuclear site in a meeting last week.</p>
<p>But his advisers warned such a move during his last weeks in office could escalate into a bigger conflict, the Times reported.</p>
<p>The meeting on Thursday took place shortly after inspectors reported a significant increase in Iran&#x2019;s stockpile of nuclear material, the report said, citing four current and former US officials.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Mr Trump asked his top national security aides what options were available and how to respond,&#x201D; the newspaper reported, citing officials.</p>
<p>The report said the attack would have likely targeted Natanz, the centrepiece of Iran&#x2019;s enrichment programme, which Tehran says is only for peaceful purposes.</p>
<p>Last week, the United Nation&#x2019;s International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) <a href="/news/2020/11/11/irans-low-enriched-uranium-stockpile-12-times-beyond-limits-un">said</a> Iran had stockpiled low-enriched uranium 12 times more than the limit set by a nuclear accord.</p>
<p>As of November 2, the nuclear watchdog said Iran had a stockpile of 2,442.9 kilogrammes (5,385.7 pounds) of low-enriched uranium, up from 2,105.4kg (4,641.6 pounds) reported on August 25.</p>
<p>The nuclear deal Iran signed in 2015 with world powers allowed it only to keep a stockpile of 202.8kg (447 pounds).</p>
<h2>&#x2018;Maximum pressure campaign&#x2019;</h2>
<p>The landmark nuclear agreement, officially known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), was signed to curb Iran&#x2019;s nuclear activities in exchange for sanctions relief.</p>
<p>The goal was to prevent the country from building a nuclear weapon, something Iran has insisted it does not intend to do.</p>
<p>However, the Iranian government began scaling back a number of its JCPOA commitments following Trump&#x2019;s decision to unilaterally withdraw the US from the accord in 2018, and the subsequent failure by its European signatories &#x2013; France, the UK and Germany &#x2013; to secure Iran the economic benefits it was promised under the deal.</p>
<p>The NYT report said Trump&#x2019;s advisers, including Vice President Mike Pence and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, illustrated the risks involved in a military escalation with Iran.</p>
<p>Officials familiar with the matter later said Trump might &#x201C;still be looking at ways to strike Iranian assets and allies, including militias in Iraq&#x201D;.</p>
<p>The US defence department and other national security officials have &#x201C;privately expressed worries that the president might initiate operations, whether overt or secret, against Iran or other adversaries at the end of his term,&#x201D; the newspaper said.</p>
<p>Tensions between Washington and Tehran have intensified after the US enforced its so-called &#x201C;maximum pressure campaign&#x201D; against Iran following its JCPOA exit.</p>
<p>The campaign included the reimposition of punishing economic sanctions that have squeezed the Iranian economy and led, among other things, to soaring inflation and shortages of medicine.</p>
<p>A change in the two countries&#x2019; nuclear diplomacy could be in sight as US President-elect Joe Biden has promised he would offer Iran &#x201C;a credible path back to diplomacy&#x201D;, marking a stark change in Trump&#x2019;s aggressive rhetoric against Iran.</p>
<p>But an escalation with Iran could make it difficult for Biden to salvage the nuclear accord, which he has pledged to rejoin &#x201C;as a starting point for follow-on negotiations&#x201D; if Tehran returns to compliance with it.</p>
