<p>The presidential hopeful accused Bush of mishandling the economy and antagonising most of the United States&#x2019; friends and allies. </p>
<p>&#x201C;Every day of this campaign, I will challenge George Bush for fundamentally taking our country in the wrong direction,&#x201D; Kerry said on Tuesday. </p>
<p>&#x201C;Today, with confidence in the courage of our people to change what is wrong and do what is right, I come here to say why I&#x2019;m a candidate for president of the United States of America,&#x201D; said Kerry, a US senator who represents the north-eastern state of Massachusetts. </p>
<p>With the aircraft carrier USS Yorktown as the backdrop, Kerry signalled in his address he was the one Democrat &#x2013; who can go toe-to-toe with Bush on national defence issues. </p>
<p>Nine other Democrat contenders have announced plans to seek the US presidency.</p>
<p><strong>Iraq miscalculation</strong></p>
<p>Kerry, a decorated Vietnam War veteran, was especially critical of the president&#x2019;s Iraq policy, and called on the White House to share the burdens of administering postwar Iraq with the United Nations.<br>&#xA0;<br>&#x201C;For the Bush administration to reject the participation of allies in the UN is a miscalculation of colossal proportions,&#x201D; he said.<br>&#xA0;<br>&#x201C;We need to end the sense of American occupation as fast as possible and take the targets off of American soldiers,&#x201D; Kerry said.</p>

<p>Security issues have generally been viewed as the Republican president&#x2019;s strong suit. But Bush is seen as increasingly vulnerable because of problems ruling an Iraq where US officials have so far failed to restore normality. </p>
<p>&#x201C;George Bush&#x2019;s vision does not live up to the America I enlisted in the navy to defend, the America I have fought for in the Senate, and the America that I hope to lead as president,&#x201D; Kerry said. </p>
<p><strong>Creed of greed</strong></p>
<p>Kerry also promised to end the &#x201C;creed of greed&#x201D; which he said characterised the Bush administration. Kerry told supporters he would work with them to reclaim fairness and equity for all US citizens &#x2013; qualities he said had been elusive in the current administration. </p>
<p>&#x201C;I&#x2019;m running so that we can keep America&#x2019;s promise to reward the hard work of middle-class Americans and pull down the barriers that stand in the way of those who are struggling to join them,&#x201D; he told a cheering crowd in Mount Pleasant, South Carolina.</p>

<p>The New England senator has been campaigning for months, but Tuesday&#x2019;s speech marked his campaign&#x2019;s official launch.</p>
<p>He hopes to capture the imagination of core Democratic voters, whose support he will need to prevail in next year&#x2019;s primary elections. </p>
<p>A senior US lawmaker with a patrician bearing and a sizeable campaign war chest, Kerry was a presumed frontrunner from the moment he announced his intention to vie for the White House in the November 2004 election. </p>
<p><strong>Democrat rivals</strong></p>
<p>But he has been overtaken in recent opinion polls and in fundraising by Howard Dean, a former Vermont governor and Washington outsider whose rough-hewn style and outspoken criticism of the Bush administration has won over many Democratic supporters.<br>&#xA0;<br>The most recent survey released jointly on Tuesday by CNN and USA Today showed Kerry coming in fourth place among registered Democrats. </p>
<p>The poll conducted by the Gallup organisation, which queried Democratic voters on their favourite choice for the party&#x2019;s nomination, put Connecticut Senator Joe Lieberman in front with 23% support, followed by US Representative Richard Gephardt of Missouri with 13%, and Dean with 12%. </p>
<p>Kerry, the choice of 10% of Democrats polled, hopes to bolster that tepid support by boosting his criticism of the president and capitalising on the anti-Bush anger that has helped propel Dean to the top of many opinion polls.</p>
