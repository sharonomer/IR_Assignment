<p>Egyptian&#xA0;<span>President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi</span>&#xA0;has pardoned more than 3,000 prisoners, in a move coinciding with the Eid al-Fitr holiday <span>marking the end of the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan.</span></p>
<p>No activists, journalists or political prisoners, however, were among the 3,157 people granted clemency late on Saturday.</p>
<p><span>According to the official gazette, one of those pardoned&#xA0;<span>was former policeman Mohsen al-Sukkari, sentenced in 2010 to 25 years for the murder of popular Lebanese singer Suzanne Tamim.</span> </span></p>
<p><span><span><span>A court had found that al-Sukkari acted on instructions from Egyptian real estate tycoon Hisham Talaat Moustafa for a payment of $2m.</span> </span> </span> The 2008 killing of Tamim, Moustafa&#x2019;s lover, sparked public outcry across the Arab region.</p>
<p>Moustafa, a well-known businessman, was sentenced to 15 years for his part in the crime, but he was granted a presidential pardon in 2017 on health grounds.</p>

<p>Rights groups say the Egyptian government&#xA0;<span>has waged an unprecedented crackdown on dissent since 2013,&#xA0;</span>when el-Sisi led a military coup that deposed his democratically-elected predecessor, President Mohamed Morsi, of the now-outlawed Muslim Brotherhood movement.</p>
<p>At least 60,000 people have been jailed on political grounds, according to an estimated by Human Rights Watch, a New York-based NGO.</p>

<p><span>Meanwhile, Amnesty International said earlier this month journalism in Egypt had effectively become a crime over the past four years. </span></p>
<p><span>The London-based group documented 37 cases of journalists arrested in the government&#x2019;s escalating crackdown on press freedom, many charged with &#x201C;spreading false news&#x201D; or &#x201C;misusing social media&#x201D; under a broad 2015 counterterrorism law that has expanded the definition of terror to include all kinds of dissent.</span></p>
<p>Al Jazeera journalist Mahmoud Hussein remains jailed in Egypt without charges or trial. The&#xA0;<span>Egyptian national, who works for the Al Jazeera Arabic television channel in&#xA0;</span>Qatar,<span>&#xA0;was arrested on arrival in Cairo on December 20, 2016, while on a personal visit to see his family.&#xA0;</span></p>
<p>The United Nations has called on Egypt to end Hussein&#x2019;s &#x201C;arbitrary detention&#x201D; and release him &#x201C;immediately&#x201D;.</p>
<p>Dalia Fahmy, an associate professor of political science at Long Island University, said el-Sisi &#x201C;has been using this system of pardoning&#x201D; on holidays to show he is doing something for society.</p>
<p>&#x201C;On the eve of Eid al-Fitr holiday, we see over 3,000 pardons &#x2013; not a single one of them is a political prisoner or a journalist, rather they are common criminals,&#x201D; she told Al Jazeera.</p>
<p>&#x201C;[But] let&#x2019;s look at what is actually happening in Egypt: there are over 60,000 political prisoners; what used to be generation protest is now known as generation jail; he&#x2019;s had had to build 16 more prisons to hold the sheer volume of prisoners,&#x201D; Fahmy added.</p>
<p>&#x201C;What we&#x2019;re seeing is that the adjudication of the law is not about the rule of law and protecting of society, it&#x2019;s actually about a part of the gamble of the president takes as how he signifies to the population that he&#x2019;s doing something for them when in reality he isn&#x2019;t.&#x201D;</p>
