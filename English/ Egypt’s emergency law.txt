<p>Egyptian parliament approved a request by the government to extend the country&#x2019;s emergency law, in place for the last 27 years. The extension comes despite promises made in 2005 by President Hosni Mubarak to abolish this law.</p>
<p>The emergency law gives the&#xA0;Egyptian government broad powers to arrest and detain suspects without charges, refer civilians to military courts, close dissident publications and thwart demonstrations. </p>
<p>It was introduced after the assassination of President Anwar Sadat during a military parade in 1981 and has been renewed every two years since.</p>
<p>In 2005 Mubarak promised to pass an anti-terror act to replace the emergency law. The act, obviously, has not been passed and the Egyptian government has used that fact to extend the emergency law.</p>
<p>But has this law served Egypt in its own &#x201C;War on terror&#x201D;?&#xA0; Will it be ever abolished during Mubarak&#x2019;s lifetime?</p>
