<p>After 20 years behind bars, Karam Zuhdi was freed by Interior Minister Habib al-Adli on Sunday for humanitarian reasons &#x2013; the former al-Jamaa al-Islamiya member suffers coronary problems, diabetes and osteoporosis.</p>
<p>Zuhdi headed the policy-making Shura council of Egypt&#x2019;s largest Islamist group that shot to notoriety in 1997 when rogue elements of the organization murdered 58 foreign tourists in Luxor.</p>
<p><strong>Truce</strong></p>
<p>Al-Jamaa al-Islamiya took part in a bloody six-year campaign in the 1990s to overthrow the Egyptian government and install an Islamic government, before calling a truce in 1997.&#xA0;<br>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; </p>

<p>Since the Luxor killings by a faction opposed to the ceasefire, there have been no similar attacks in Egypt. <br>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; <br>In recent months, Egypt has published several interviews with jailed al-Jamaa leaders, including Zuhdi, reiterating their commitment to the ceasefire.&#xA0;</p>
<p><strong>Decreasing threat</strong></p>
<p>Security analysts say the interviews are part of government efforts to give moderate Islamists a louder voice to counter any latent threats from those who still espouse violence. <br>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; <br>Some analysts have speculated the government may release people like Zuhdi from jail to give them greater influence in Islamist circles. <br>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; <br>Egypt&#x2019;s Middle East News Agency said the interior minister would release several suspected members of al-Gamaa who had completed their jail terms and had genuinely repented for their crimes.</p>
