<p>Egyptian officials have arrested a journalist at a major newspaper on &#x201C;terrorism&#x201D; charges, his lawyer said, a move a global press advocacy group called a &#x201C;brutal campaign&#x201D; against journalists in the country.</p>
<p>Security officers burst into the home of Haisam Hasan Mahgoub in the capital of Cairo earlier this week, confiscating his phone and arresting him, lawyer Karim Abdelrady said.</p>
<p>Mahgoub, a regular correspondent at the independent Egyptian daily, Al-Masry Al-Youm, was questioned by prosecutors on Wednesday and detained on charges of joining and financing a &#x201C;terrorist group&#x201D; as well as spreading &#x201C;fake news&#x201D; that threatens national security, Abdelrady said.</p>
<p>The prosecutors did not specify what constituted &#x201C;fake news&#x201D;.</p>
<p>Another journalist, freelance photographer Moataz Abdel Wahab, faces charges in the same case, Abdelrady added.</p>
<p>Egyptian officials have increasingly deployed the vague accusation of &#x201C;fake news&#x201D; to silence and jail critics in the government&#x2019;s sweeping and often indiscriminate crackdown on dissent.</p>
<p>Among dozens of media workers imprisoned in Egypt is Al Jazeera&#x2019;s Mahmoud Hussein, a Doha-based journalist who was arrested in 2016 during a visit to his family in Cairo.</p>
<p>He has been detained without charge for more than 1,200 days, and there are concerns for his health during the coronavirus pandemic.</p>

<h2>&#x2018;Brutal campaign to silence journalists&#x2019;</h2>
<p>In a statement emailed to Al Jazeera, the International Press Institute (IPI) criticised Egypt for&#xA0;Mahgoub&#x2019;s arrest, describing it as part of a &#x201C;brutal campaign of President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi to silence critical journalists&#x201D;.</p>
<p>&#x201C;The Egyptian government continues to brazenly violate press freedom by arresting journalists, raiding media outlets and blocking news websites to stifle criticism, while the international community has turned a blind eye to the harassment of journalists in the country,&#x201D; IPI director of advocacy Ravi R Prasad said.</p>
<p>&#x201C;The international community should hold Egypt&#x2019;s authoritarian regime accountable for the violation of human rights.&#x201D;</p>
<p>The IPI said Egypt has waged an &#x201C;aggressive campaign&#x201D; against the independent media, with more than 60 journalists behind bars in the country.</p>
<p>The Committee to Protect Journalists, a New York-based watchdog, linked Mahgoub&#x2019;s arrest to a clampdown that has accelerated in the shadow of the coronavirus pandemic, noting that he had recently covered human interest stories about the health crisis.</p>
<p>&#x201C;While some governments worldwide pardon prisoners during the time of COVID-19, Egypt is determined to keep its prisons full of journalists instead of letting them cover the pandemic and other news events freely,&#x201D; said Sherif Mansour, the group&#x2019;s Middle East and North Africa coordinator.</p>
<p>Egypt&#x2019;s interior ministry did not immediately respond to requests for comment.</p>
<p>Since coming to power in 2013, el-Sisi has sought to quash opposition, branding his critics as &#x201C;terrorists&#x201D; and forcing news outlets to follow the official line or disappear.</p>
<p>Last week, el-Sisi approved amendments to the country&#x2019;s emergency law, citing the coronavirus, with officials claiming the new measures were needed to address the legal &#x201C;vacuum&#x201D; caused by the outbreak.</p>
<p>The government is using the COVID-19 emergency to further tighten its grip, rights groups say.</p>
<p>In March, Egypt expelled a correspondent for the United Kingdom newspaper The Guardian over an article that indicated the coronavirus infection rate might be higher than officially reported.</p>
<p>Over a dozen people have been detained or slapped with steep fines over social media posts or reporting about the outbreak, according to Amnesty International.</p>
