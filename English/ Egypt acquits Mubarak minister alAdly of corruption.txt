<p><span>An Egyptian court has acquitted a senior official from former president Hosni Mubarak&#x2019;s government&#xA0;on corruption charges, in&#xA0;the latest ruling to clear a prominent figure from the ousted leader&#x2019;s era.</span></p>
<p><span>Habib al-Adly was cleared of&#xA0;illegally amassing $23m and was expected be &#x201C;released soon,&#x201D;&#xA0;his lawyer and state media said on Thursday.</span></p>
<p><span>Adly, who served as interior minister and oversaw the country&#x2019;s police force, was&#xA0;acquitted&#xA0;last year along with Mubarak and six others on charges relating to the deaths of protesters during 2011 that helped</span>&#xA0;lead to the government&#x2019;s downfall.</p>
<p>Last month, an appeals court overturned a suspended five-year sentence against Adly and former premier Ahmed Nazif over other corruption charges.</p>
<p>While the courts have been gradually absolving Mubarak-era officials, they have been handing down lengthy sentences to liberal and Islamist activists in cases ranging from protesting to committing acts of violence.</p>
<p><span>Morsi was ousted in 2013 by then army chief Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, who was subsequently elected as his successor.</span></p>
