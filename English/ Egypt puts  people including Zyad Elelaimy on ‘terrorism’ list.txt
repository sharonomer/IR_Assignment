<p>Egypt has added 13 people, including former legislator <span>Zyad Elelaimy</span>, on the country&#x2019;s &#x201C;terrorism list&#x201D; for collaborating with the outlawed Muslim Brotherhood.</p>
<p>Saturday&#x2019;s decision, published in the official gazette, stated that their &#x201C;placement on the terrorism list will be for a period of five years&#x201D;.</p>
<p><span>Elelaimy</span>, a key figure of Egypt&#x2019;s 2011 popular uprising that toppled longtime President Hosni Mubarak, was arrested in June 2019.</p>
<p>Also put on the list was Ramy Shaath, a prominent activist who holds Egyptian citizenship and was arrested two months after <span>Elelaimy</span>.</p>
<p>Since their arrest, the pair have been charged with joining a &#x201C;terrorist group&#x201D;, namely the Muslim Brotherhood, which has been outlawed following the 2013 overthrow of Islamist President Mohamed Morsi.</p>
<p>In its ruling Saturday, the court said Brotherhood members had tasked &#x201C;other members of the group &#x2026; including Ramy Shaath and Zyad al-Elaimy&#x201D; with carrying out activities against the state.</p>

<p>Defence lawyer Khaled Ali told AFP news agency the decision was taken in the absence of the lawyers and would be appealed.</p>
<p>Hundreds of people have been added to Egypt&#x2019;s terrorism list in recent years, including fugitives and people arrested by authorities.</p>
<p>The measure authorises the authorities to freeze their assets while those who are not behind bars are banned from travel.</p>
<p>Authorities have arrested thousands of Morsi supporters since his removal, as well as secular activists, journalists, lawyers and academics.</p>
