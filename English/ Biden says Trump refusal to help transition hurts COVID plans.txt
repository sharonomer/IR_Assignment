<p>President-elect Joe Biden said his transition &#x201C;should be further along&#x201D; and President Donald Trump&#x2019;s refusal to acknowledge the outcome of the 2020 election is creating problems in the nation&#x2019;s response to the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>&#x201C;There&#x2019;s a whole lot of things that are just &#x2013; we just don&#x2019;t have available to us, which unless made available soon, we&#x2019;re going to be behind by weeks or months,&#x201D; President-elect Biden said in a virtual meeting with front-line healthcare workers.</p>
<p>Biden, who is the apparent winner of the election, faulted the Trump administration for not following US law providing for a cooperative transition between presidents.</p>
<p>&#x201C;What we&#x2019;re having now is the failure of the administration to recognise what the law says,&#x201D; Biden said.</p>
<p>As a result, &#x201C;we&#x2019;ve been unable to get access to the kinds of things we need to know,&#x201D; he said.</p>
<p>The Trump administration is preventing Biden&#x2019;s incoming team from learning about stockpiles of personal protective equipment (PPE), he said. &#x201C;We know there&#x2019;s not much at all.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Importantly, Biden said his transition team is being prevented from learning what the plan is for distributing vaccines as they become available.</p>
<p>Two vaccine makers have announced positive results from large-scale clinical trials. The Trump administration has prepared a plan called &#x201C;Operation Warp Speed&#x201D; in which doses of the vaccines have been manufactured in advance and will be distributed by the US military.</p>
<p>Biden&#x2019;s remarks came in a virtual conference with representatives of doctors, nurses and first responders organised by his transition team.</p>

<p>Biden promised to make funding for states and localities a priority when he takes office in January and suggested Republicans have resisted including local funding in a pandemic-relief package &#x201C;because of their fear of retribution from the president&#x201D;.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Hopefully, when he&#x2019;s gone, they&#x2019;ll be more willing to do what they know should be done, has to be done, in order to save the communities they live in,&#x201D; Biden said.</p>
<p>States are facing enormous financial shortfalls as a result of lost tax revenue related to the pandemic that may threaten local healthcare systems, law enforcement and education.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, legislators on both sides of the aisle were criticised by a Wall Street titan, who urged Republicans and Democrats to split their differences and cut a deal.</p>
<p>&#x201C;This is childish behaviour on the part of our politicians,&#x201D; JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co Chief Executive Jamie Dimon told a New York Times conference.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Just get it done,&#x201D; Dimon said.</p>

<p>&#x201C;Our colleagues face a simple choice. They put the election behind them and work across the aisle to get something done, or they can remain in their partisan corner,&#x201D; Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer said.</p>
<p>Before the November 3 election, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin tried but failed to agree on a relief package of approximately $2 trillion.</p>
<p>Republican leader Mitch McConnell, who favours a $500bn package, said Congress should aim for agreement on items where there is already compromise.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Republicans stand ready to deliver this urgent aid. Let&#x2019;s fund all the programmes where there&#x2019;s not even real disagreement. Just this once, where there&#x2019;s no disagreement. And let&#x2019;s do it now. We just need Democrats to finally get serious about this,&#x201D; McConnell said.</p>
