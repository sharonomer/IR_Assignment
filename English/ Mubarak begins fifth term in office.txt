<p>Nine candidates ran in the 7 September election against Mubarak, but only two of them were serious challengers.</p>
<p>Ayman Nour of the opposition Al-Ghad party and Numan Gumaa of the Wafd party took 7.3% and 2.8% of the vote respectively.</p>
<p>During the campaign, Mubarak promised to surrender some of his wide reaching powers to the cabinet and the legislature.</p>
<p>He also pledged to implement a package of measures to create millions of jobs, better housing and health care, and to raise wages for government employees.</p>
<p>Mubarak, a former air force general, came to office in 1981 after the assassination of president Anwar al-Sadat at a Cairo military parade.</p>
<p><strong>Government resignation</strong></p>
<p>The Egyptian government is due to hand in its resignation on Tuesday, but Mubarak said its dissolution was only a technicality, and that a new line-up would only emerge after November parliamentary elections.</p>
<p>&#x201C;The government will tender its resignation after the oath-taking ceremony and I will ask it to continue its work until the formation of a new government after the legislative polls,&#x201D; he told the state-owned Roz al-Yusef newspaper.</p>

<p>Even the reform that led to the opening up of the presidential contest was much criticised, with many candidates barred from standing, while others refused to put anyone forward saying the outcome was a foregone conclusion.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN:0cm 0cm 0pt;mso-layout-grid-align:none">After his victory, Mubarak insisted the pursuit of political reforms was &#x201C;irrevocable&#x201D;, vowing &#x201C;to build a modern society in a democratic country&#x201D;.</p>
<p>In a related development, newly appointed US Undersecretary for Public Diplomacy Karen Hughes, after meeting Egyptian Prime Minister Ahmed Nazif on Monday, said Mubarak made &#x201C;a pledge about the lifting of emergency laws to the people of Egypt as part of the presidential campaign&#x201D;.</p>
<p><strong>Egyptian Dynasty?</strong></p>
<p>Hughes quoted Nazif as telling her: &#x201C;It would take some time because it involves legal and constitutional changes, but that they have every intention to act on the reforms the president outlined during his campaign.&#x201D;</p>
<p>When the government reshuffle takes place, pro-Western reformists within the ruling National Democratic Party and headed by Mubarak&#x2019;s son Jamal seem likely to get some important posts.</p>
<p>But the idea that Jamal may himself one day succeed his father as president remains controversial, with even those uninvolved in pushing for further democratic reforms opposed to the idea of an Egyptian dynasty.</p>
