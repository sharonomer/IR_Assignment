<p>The far-right <a href="/news/2020/08/russian-backed-organisations-amplify-qanon-conspiracy-theories-200824140346496.html">QAnon conspiracy</a> theory has made waves in this election after US President Donald Trump&#x2019;s acknowledgement of its adherents in August and an increase in Republican and independent congressional candidates embracing the movement, which many consider a mad hoax or even a cult.</p>
<p>Followers believe a high-ranking, anonymous government official called &#x201C;Q&#x201D; is providing top-secret information in internet posts about a cannibalistic, satanic cabal of &#x201C;Deep State&#x201D; actors engaged in a child trafficking ring that Trump has been chosen to dismantle.</p>
<p>Some also believe the conspirators are extracting chemicals from the children&#x2019;s blood to extend their lives.</p>
<p>But this is only the core of the conspiracy theory, which spreads and subsumes further conspiracies.</p>
<h2>Q&#x2019;s history and reach</h2>
<p>The identity of Q &#x2013; presumed to be called as such because those with &#x201C;Q clearance&#x201D; at the Department of Energy can view classified information &#x2013; is unknown, though they are assumed to be a United States citizen.</p>

<p>Given the subject matter, Q&#x2019;s information surfaced on the darker corners of the internet. Q made their first revelation or &#x201C;drop&#x201D; in October 2017 on 4Chan, a controversial imageboard, or online forum that revolves around posting images, often with accompanying text and discussions.</p>
<p>The post was named &#x201C;Calm Before the Storm&#x201D;, the storm being an event in which 100,000 politicians, business people and celebrities involved in the central plot will be gathered and held accountable.</p>
<p>The anonymous user has accused liberals of various stripes of being involved in the plot, including former President Barack Obama, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and liberal financier <a href="/news/2018/06/soros-obsession-conspiracy-theories-prevail-180604210828301.html">George Soros</a>, causing accusations of anti-Semitism.</p>
<p>Celebrities and members of the media, too, are said to be involved.</p>
<p>Other posts are more cryptic, seemingly providing clues to a larger puzzle surrounding the plot to foil Trump, who was recruited by top military brass to run for president in 2016 to stop the satanic, child-trafficking cabal.</p>
<p></p><figure id="attachment_1192521" style="width:770px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-fantasia-770 wp-image-1192521" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/000_8RF4WW.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513" data-recalc-dims="1">The QAnon conspiracy movement has exploded from the US political fringe into the global mainstream during the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic [File: Joseph Prezioso/AFP]</figure>Q&#x2019;s messages moved to 8chan, another imageboard with links to white supremacy and child pornography and then to 8kun, 8chan&#x2019;s successor.<p></p>
<p>Q&#x2019;s information is not limited to the satanic, child-trafficking cabal of liberal elites. It has united various conspiracy theories, such as UFOs, Area 51 and faked-death plots.</p>
<p>For example, some followers believe that John F Kennedy Jr, the son of former president John F Kennedy, faked his death in 1999 and is Q.</p>
<p>Kennedy died in a plane crash, following the assassinations of both his father in 1963 and his uncle, Robert F Kennedy, in 1968 during his campaign for president. All of these deaths were major events in US politics and have their own set of years-old, surrounding conspiracies.</p>

<p>A man from North Carolina travelled to the pizzeria and opened fire with a rifle after delving into the theory. No one was killed.</p>
<h2>Adherents, violence and reaction</h2>
<p>It&#x2019;s unclear how many people ascribe to the far-reaching, far-right theories &#x2013; and how seriously &#x2013; but they have made their presence known both online and in real life.</p>
<p>Facebook groups dedicated to the theory have millions of followers, according to documents resulting from an <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/qanon-groups-have-millions-members-facebook-documents-show-n1236317" target="_blank">internal review</a> seen by NBC News.</p>
<p>Twitter and Facebook have both removed hundreds of accounts associated with the conspiracy on their platforms, with Facebook announcing it would <a href="/news/2020/10/6/facebook-bans-all-qanon-groups-as-amid-surging-misinformation">ban</a> all Qanon accounts across their platforms on October 6.</p>
<p>Twitter removed about 7,000 accounts in July, but the Washington Post <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/10/03/twitter-banished-worst-qanon-accounts-more-than-93000-remain-site-research-shows/" target="_blank">reports</a> roughly 93,000 remain.</p>
<p>Believers of the hoax have been linked to violence and plots to <a href="https://www.reviewjournal.com/crime/courts/suspect-in-hoover-dam-standoff-writes-trump-cites-conspiracy-in-letters/" target="_blank">harm infrastructure</a> and people, including the <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/a-qanon-devotee-live-streamed-her-trip-to-ny-to-take-out-joe-biden" target="_blank">targeting</a> of Democratic presidential candidate and former Vice President Joe Biden and the killing of a Gambino crime boss on Staten Island.</p>
<p>Adherents began showing up at Trump campaign rallies in 2018 and continue to be sighted at these events.</p>
<p>Michael &#x201C;Lionel&#x201D; Lebron, a prominent supporter and promoter of the theory, was granted a photo with the president inside the Oval Office in August of that year.</p>

<p>Vice President <a href="/news/2020/09/mike-pence-backs-fundraiser-hosted-qanon-supporters-200912171621142.html">Mike Pence</a> was then photographed having a jovial conversation with members of the Broward County, Florida, SWAT team in November 2018. One of the law enforcement officers was wearing a patch associated with the theory.</p>
<p>Members of the Trump administration have condemned the group, but Trump himself defended adherents at a news conference in August.</p>
<p>&#x201C;I heard that these are people that love our country&#x201D;, Trump said in his first public comment on the subject. &#x201C;So I don&#x2019;t know really anything about it other than they do supposedly like me.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Trump also congratulated <a href="/news/2020/08/georgia-republican-greene-supported-qanon-wins-primary-200812130157625.html">Marjorie Taylor Greene</a>, who has voiced support for QAnon, after she won a Republican congressional primary contest in Georgia that month.</p>
<h2>A theory, movement, or a cult?</h2>
<p>QAnon and its complicated web of conspiracies are fast-growing in Europe, according to researchers.</p>
<p>&#x201C;We are witnessing the adaptation of these theories into EU-centered &#x2013; or even local &#x2013; narratives, where they merge with pre-existing conspiracies and groups,&#x201D; NewsGuard, a fake news monitor said in a July report.</p>
<p>NewsGuard&#x2019;s editor&#xA0;Chine Labbe told AFP that QAnon &#x201C;continues to grow exponentially&#x201D; throughout Europe.</p>
<p>While many refer to QAnon as a conspiracy theory, and some of its adherents refer to it as a movement, some observers are increasingly calling it a &#x201C;cult&#x201D; for its adaptability, its effect on the way people view reality and sense of unity among followers.</p>
<p>QAnon&#x2019;s slogan, &#x201C;Where We Go One, We Go All&#x201D; or WWG1WGA has frequently been seen at recent right-wing demonstrations.</p>
<p>&#x201C;I have just started describing QAnon as a digital cult instead of a conspiracy theory &#x2026; I actually think it&#x2019;s more accurate,&#x201D; Aoife Gallagher, a disinformation and extremism analyst at the London-based Institute for Strategic Dialogue told USA Today.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Cult&#x201D; or not, with at least 24 congressional candidates publicly supporting the theories and Trump praising them, QAnon seems poised to remain a player in US politics &#x2013; and possibly abroad &#x2013; for years to come.</p>
