<p>United States Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton has won the South Carolina primary over rival Bernie Sanders, propelling her into next week&#x2019;s crucial &#x201C;Super Tuesday&#x201D; voting in 11 states on a wave of momentum.</p>
<p>With almost all of the votes counted on Saturday night, Clinton was easily winning with more than 73 percent.</p>
<p>&#x201C;To South Carolina, to the volunteers at the heart of our campaign, to the supporters who power it: thank you,&#x201D; Clinton tweeted after major US networks all called the vote in her favour at the close of polls.</p>
<p>Huge cheers broke out at the venue in Columbia, South Carolina, where Clinton was due to deliver a victory speech to supporters.</p>
<p>&#x201C;It&#x2019;s time, it&#x2019;s time, it&#x2019;s time for a woman in the White House,&#x201D; the crowd chanted.</p>

<p>Sanders immediately congratulated his rival, while vowing to fight on for the party&#x2019;s presidential nomination. <br> &#x201C;This campaign is just beginning,&#x201D; he said in a statement.</p>
<p>&#x201C;We won a decisive victory in New Hampshire. She won a decisive victory in South Carolina. Now it&#x2019;s on to Super Tuesday.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Al Jazeera&#x2019;s Kimberly Halkett, reporting from Columbia, South Carolina, said that Clinton&#x2019;s win &#x201C;offers a tremendous psychological and political victory&#x201D; ahead of Tuesday&#x2019;s contests.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Sanders says he is not giving up&#x2026;but he is struggling to prove that he is a viable candidate,&#x201D; she said.</p>
<p>The win was Clinton&#x2019;s third victory in the first four Democratic contests, and solidified her status as the strong frontrunner to capture the party&#x2019;s nomination for the November 8 presidential election.</p>
<p>The former secretary of state&#x2019;s victory also established her strength among black voters, a crucial Democratic constituency who make up more than half of the party&#x2019;s primary electorate in South Carolina.</p>
<p>The result raised more questions about whether Sanders, the democratic socialist US senator from Vermont, will be able to compete away from his home base of Northeastern liberals.</p>
