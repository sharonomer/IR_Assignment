<p>Egyptian President <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/topics/people/abdel-fattah-el-sisi.html">Abdel Fattah el-Sisi</a> left Cairo for Washington where both sides will seek a renewed relationship after tensions over Sisi&#x2019;s crackdown on opponents.</p>
<p>As well as meeting President <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/topics/people/donald-trump.html">Donald Trump</a>, Sisi will see the top officials at the <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/topics/organisations/world-bank.html">World Bank</a> and International Monetary Fund, where he will pitch for help with his country&#x2019;s ailing economy.</p>
<p>A senior White house official said on Friday that Trump &#x201C;wants to use President Sisi&#x2019;s visit to reboot the bilateral relationship and build on the strong connection the two presidents established when they first met in New York last September&#x201D;.</p>

<p>The trip will be Sisi&#x2019;s first US state visit since being elected president in 2014 as former US President <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/topics/people/barack-obama.html">Barack Obama</a> had never extended an invitation.</p>
<p>The bilateral relationship was strained when Obama criticised Sisi for cracking down on the <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/topics/organisations/muslim-brotherhood.html">Muslim Brotherhood</a>.</p>
<p>Sisi was elected a year after leading the military&#x2019;s removal of the Muslim Brotherhood&#x2019;s President <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/topics/people/mohamed-morsi.html">Mohamed Morsi</a> after mass protests.</p>
<p>The country is fighting an internal conflict in Sinai, and hundreds of Egyptian soldiers and police have been killed fighting armed groups.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/egypt.html">Egypt</a> has been negotiating billions of dollars in aid from various lenders to help revive an economy hit by political upheaval since a 2011 revolt and to ease a dollar shortage that has crippled imports, drove away foreign investors and hampered its recovery.</p>
<p>Egypt received the first tranche of a three-year $12bn loan deal with the <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/topics/organisations/imf.html">IMF</a> and is expecting to receive the second tranche soon.</p>

<p>The second tranche of a $3bn loan from the World Bank was disbursed to Egypt last month.</p>
<p>The statement said Sisi is also scheduled to meet leaders of the American chamber of commerce and heads of major United States companies to discuss investment opportunities in Egypt.</p>
<h2>Trump&#x2019;s &#x2018;fantastic guy&#x2019;&#xA0;</h2>
<p>When Sisi meets Trump on Monday during his first state visit to Washington, he will see a counterpart who better appreciates his &#x201C;mission&#x201D; to fight rebels and armed groups, without Obama&#x2019;s hand-wringing over <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/topics/categories/human_rights.html">human rights</a>.</p>
<p>&#x201C;As a matter of fact, President-elect Trump has shown deep and great understanding of what is taking place in the region as a whole and what is taking place in Egypt,&#x201D; Sisi, who met Trump in September before his election, said in an interview.</p>
<p>A senior White House official said Friday that Trump wants to &#x201C;build on the strong connection the two presidents established&#x201D; then.</p>

<p>&#x201C;He&#x2019;s a fantastic guy. Took control of Egypt, and he really took control of it,&#x201D; he told Fox Business of the period after Morsi&#x2019;s overthrow which saw hundreds of protesters killed and thousands detained.</p>
<p>Over the past three years, Sisi has met a trickle of delegations from American think-tanks and other groups, drumming home the importance of supporting him.</p>
<p>Egypt is part of the international coalition against the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (<a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/topics/organisations/isis-isil.html">ISIL</a>, also known as ISIS) group, but is bogged down fighting the armed group&#x2019;s affiliate in the Sinai Peninsula, where they have killed hundreds of soldiers and policemen.</p>
<p>Western officials who requested anonymity told AFP news agency that Egypt is primarily interested in advanced military hardware it believes Western countries are withholding.</p>
<p>Cairo also wants conventional equipment that Washington believes is not useful for a counterinsurgency campaign.</p>
