<p><span lang="EN-GB">In party-political terms, Islamophobia is now a vote-winner in right-wing Republican circles.

<p><strong><span lang="EN-GB">Push-back</span></strong></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB">On Wednesday, the commander-in-chief </span><span lang="EN-GB"><a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2016/02/03/email-rumana-ahmed-tune-presidents-mosque-visit" target="_blank">pushed back</a></span><span lang="EN-GB">. Obama loudly denounced &#x201C;distorted media portrayals&#x201D; of Islam and the people &#x201C;conflating the horrific acts of terrorism with the beliefs of an entire faith&#x201D;. He condemned the &#x201C;inexcusable political rhetoric against Muslim Americans that has no place in our country&#x201D; and drew a causal link between hate speech and violence.</span></p>
		<blockquote>
			<p>Putting aside some of my own criticisms of Obama&apos;s domestic and foreign policies for a moment, let me say this, on behalf of my Muslim-American daughters and my headscarf-wearing Muslim-American wife, who has been verbally abused on the streets of this nation&apos;s capital: thank you, Mr President.</p>
			<p class="quote-author"> </p>
		</blockquote>
		
<p><span lang="EN-GB">&#x201C;No surprise, then, that threats and harassment of Muslim Americans have surged,&#x201D; he told his audience in Maryland. &#x201C;Here at this mosque, twice last year, threats were made against your children.&#xA0;Around the country, women wearing the hijab &#x2026; have been targeted. We&#x2019;ve seen children bullied. We&#x2019;ve seen mosques vandalised.&#x201D; The first non-white president of the US also had no qualms about identifying the racial component of Islamophobia: &#x201C;Sikh Americans and others who are perceived to be Muslims have been targeted, as well.&#x201D;</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB">Dismissing talk of a &#x201C;clash of civilisations between the West and Islam&#x201D;, Obama refused to ask Muslim Americans to choose between their identities. &#x201C;You&#x2019;re not Muslim or American,&#x201D; declaimed the president. &#x201C;You&#x2019;re Muslim and American.&#x201D;</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB">To which the only sane response from any Muslim, and anyone who claims to care about racial equality or religious liberty, surely has to be: Hallelujah!</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB">Yes, Obama has been silent on the issue of growing Islamophobia for far too long (though, to his credit, he did </span><span lang="EN-GB"><a href="http://www.mediaite.com/tv/obama-indirectly-rips-trump-in-sotu-for-anti-muslim-talk-this-isnt-about-being-pc/" target="_blank">slam Trump&#x2019;s anti-Muslim vitriol</a></span><span lang="EN-GB"> in his State of the Union speech in January).</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB">Yes, he should have visited a US mosque much earlier in his presidency: it is scandalous that Obama&#x2019;s trip to the Islamic Society of Baltimore on Wednesday was his </span><span lang="EN-GB">first appearance at a mosque on US soil<span> since entering the White House (a mosque which, as it happens, is less than 50 miles from his Pennsylvania Avenue home).</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span lang="EN-GB">Bigotry prevails</span></strong></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB">A belated denunciation of anti-Muslim bigotry from the president of the US, in front of a Muslim audience in a mosque, is a denunciation nevertheless. A much-needed denunciation from the most important public figure in the land. Would some of his Muslim critics, I wonder, prefer it if he had not given the speech?</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB">In fact, given the rise of Trump and the fallout from the </span><span lang="EN-GB"><a class="internallink" href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2015/12/wife-san-bernardino-attack-pledged-support-isil-151204163031407.html" target="_blank">massacre in San Bernardino, California</a></span><span lang="EN-GB">, Obama&#x2019;s timing, ironically and unwittingly, couldn&#x2019;t have been better. &#x201C;Coming to a mosque is a public reminder that Muslims have been part of America since our nation&#x2019;s founding,&#x201D; Farhana Khera of Muslim Advocates </span><span lang="EN-GB"><a href="http://www.cnn.com/2016/02/03/politics/obama-mosque-visit-muslim-rhetoric/" target="_blank">told CNN</a></span><span lang="EN-GB"> in the run-up to the event.</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB">A public reminder in an era in which, as the president himself openly acknowledged and the statistics </span><span lang="EN-GB"><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/02/03/the-importance-of-obamas-mosque-visit-in-an-era-of-hate-crimes-against-muslims/" target="_blank">clearly demonstrate</a>,</span><span lang="EN-GB"> there has been a surge in the number of attacks on Muslims and mosques in the US.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB">A public reminder, to quote Obama, that &#x201C;an attack on one faith is an attack on all our faiths,&#x201D; especially in the midst of a Republican primary campaign in which proudly Christian candidates rush to smear and stigmatise Muslims. (Marco Rubio, incidentally, </span><span lang="EN-GB"><a href="http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/268165-rubio-slams-obamas-mosque-visit-hes-pitting-people-against-each-other" target="_blank">claimed</a></span><span lang="EN-GB"> Obama&#x2019;s mosque visit was another example of him &#x201C;pitting people against each other&#x201D;; Trump </span><span lang="EN-GB"><a href="http://www.cnn.com/2016/02/03/politics/donald-trump-barack-obama-mosque/index.html" target="_blank">sneered</a></span><span lang="EN-GB"> that the president &#x201C;feels comfortable there&#x201D;.)</span></p>
<p><strong><span lang="EN-GB">Mere rhetoric?</span></strong></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB">As I have </span><span lang="EN-GB"><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2010/sep/10/obama-muslim-hearts-and-minds">argued</a>&#xA0;</span><span lang="EN-GB"><a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/mehdi-hasan/barack-obama-worse-than-bush_b_3439999.html" target="_blank">elsewhere</a></span><span lang="EN-GB">, Obama&#x2019;s own official statements and&#xA0;policies on counterterrorism and civil liberties issues have been far from perfect. From </span><span lang="EN-GB"><a href="http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/the-n-s-a-s-spying-on-muslim-americans" target="_blank">NSA spying on Muslim Americans</a></span><span lang="EN-GB"> to </span><span lang="EN-GB"><a href="https://www.thebureauinvestigates.com/category/projects/drones/" target="_blank">drone strikes in Pakistan</a></span><span lang="EN-GB">, from </span><span lang="EN-GB"><a href="http://thinkprogress.org/justice/2016/01/20/3741077/airport-profiling-islamophobia/" target="_blank">anti-Muslim profiling at US airports</a></span><span lang="EN-GB"> to </span><span lang="EN-GB"><a href="http://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/1.605982" target="_blank">support for Israel&#x2019;s bombardment of Gaza</a></span><span lang="EN-GB">, the president has undoubtedly upset, frustrated and angered millions of Muslims at home and abroad.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB">Some might justifiably argue that his administration&#x2019;s militarism and surveillance helped to incite the fear of, and hatred towards, Muslim Americans that he so eloquently rebuked in his speech on Wednesday.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB">Cynics, therefore, may dismiss Obama&#x2019;s mosque speech as mere rhetoric. But rhetoric matters. Those who argue that the president&#x2019;s speech won&#x2019;t, or can&#x2019;t, have an impact are either naive or disingenuous.</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB">It may indeed be depressing and disturbing that, in 2016, the US president feels compelled to make a speech reminding Muslim Americans that &#x201C;you&#x2019;re right where you belong. You&#x2019;re part of America, too&#x201D;. But, to be honest, I&#x2019;m glad he did. And I also worry whether the next president will even bother.</span></p>
