<p>President <a class="InternalLink" href="/topics/people/donald-trump.html">Donald Trump</a>&#xA0;has said deploying the US military to <a href="/topics/country/venezuela.html">Venezuela</a> is &#x201C;an option&#x201D;.</p>
<p><span><span><span>&#x201C;Well, I don&#x2019;t want to say that. But certainly, it&#x2019;s something that&#x2019;s on the &#x2013; it&#x2019;s an option,&#x201D; Trump said on CBS&#x2019;s Face the Nation programme on Sunday when asked if he would use the American forces during Venezuela&#x2019;s crisis.</span>&#xA0;</span></span></p>
<p>The <a href="/topics/country/united-states.html">US</a> recognised Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaido, who declared himself interim president on January 23, and is leading an international campaign to drive&#xA0;<a class="InternalLink" href="/topics/people/nicolas-maduro.html">Nicolas Maduro</a> from office.</p>
<p>Trump also said Maduro&#xA0;requested a meeting with him &#x201C;a number of months ago&#x201D; but he declined it.</p>

<p>&#x201C;I decided at the time &#x2018;no&#x2019; because so many really horrible things have been happening in Venezuela,&#x201D; he said, citing the &#x201C;poverty, anguish, and crime&#x201D; in a country that was once one of the wealthiest in Latin America.</p>
<p>Trump again praised Guaido describing him as &#x201C;<span>a young and energetic gentleman&#x201D;.&#xA0;</span></p>
<p>&#x201C;I<span>f you talk about democracy &#x2013; it&#x2019;s really democracy in action&#x2026;&#xA0;</span>I think the process is playing out &#x2013; very, very big tremendous protests.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Four major European nations &#x2013; Britain, France, Germany and Spain &#x2013; said they will recognise Guaido unless <a href="/news/2019/01/venezuela-crisis-latest-updates-190123205835912.html">Maduro calls new presidential elections</a> by midnight on Sunday.</p>
<p>Trump has repeatedly warned &#x201C;all options are on the table&#x201D; in Venezuela, as his administration ramps up pressure on Maduro through economic sanctions and appeals to the country&#x2019;s armed forces to switch allegiances.</p>

<h2><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpAR_gS4KYM" target="_blank"><strong>&#x2018;P<span>oint of no return</span>&#x2018;</strong></a></h2>
<p>The US, Canada and several Latin American countries have disavowed Maduro over his disputed re-election last year and also recognised Guaido as the interim president.</p>
<p>Maduro, however, maintains the powerful backing of Russia, China and Turkey. Russian foreign minister said on Sunday that Western meddling was instigating Venezuela&#x2019;s troubles and punishing millions of its people.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Venezuela has reached a point of no return,&#x201D; political analyst Marco Terugi told Al Jazeera. &#x201C;We now have a government that was democratically elected, and a parallel government controlled and led by the US.&#x201D;&#xA0;</p>
<p>Russia&#x2019;s foreign ministry said on Sunday the international community should focus on helping to solve Venezuela&#x2019;s economic and social problems and refrain from any &#x201C;destructive&#x201D; interference.</p>
<p>&#x201C;The international community&#x2019;s goal should be to help without destructive meddling from beyond its borders,&#x201D; Alexander Shchetinin, head of the ministry&#x2019;s Latin American department, was cited by Interfax news agency as saying.</p>
<p>Journalist Robert Valencia from Global Voices said global geopolitics could be coming to a head, noting Russia <a href="/news/2018/12/clone.of.russia-scoffs-criticism-bomber-deployment.html">deployed two nuclear-capable bombers</a> to&#xA0;<span>the Latin American nation</span> in December &#x2013; a move that riled the US.&#xA0;</p>
<p>&#x201C;I think we&#x2019;re talking about a new tug-of-war between two current powers in the world &#x2013; the United States and Russia. We are seeing something that has happened in Syria and now could be moved into Venezuela&#x2026; This is going to be a new struggle for the balance of power,&#x201D; he said.&#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0;</p>
<p><span style="font-size:1.5em"><strong>At a crossroad</strong>&#xA0;</span></p>
<p>Tens of thousands of people thronged the streets of various Venezuelan cities on Saturday to protest his government and a senior air force general recognised Guaido.</p>

<p>The Trump administration last week issued crippling sanctions that are likely to further weaken the country&#x2019;s struggling oil industry &#x2013; by far Venezuela&#x2019;s greatest source of income.</p>
<p>While that could weaken Maduro, it risks also exacerbating Venezuela&#x2019;s economic collapse.</p>
<p>Venezuela is suffering medicine shortages, malnutrition and hyperinflation that has prompted millions to emigrate in recent years.</p>
