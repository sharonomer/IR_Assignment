<p>Thousands of Egyptians rallied in cities across <a href="/topics/country/egypt.html">Egypt</a> on Friday calling for the resignation of President <a href="/topics/people/abdel-fattah-el-sisi.html">Abdel Fattah el-Sisi</a>.</p>
<p>The rare display of public dissent came after a call for protests by&#xA0;Mohamed Ali, a building contractor and actor who has accused the president and the military of corruption.</p>
<p>Before fleeing to&#xA0;<a href="/topics/country/Spain.html">Spain</a>&#xA0;where he now lives<span>&#xA0;in self-imposed exile</span>, Ali says the company he managed implemented projects for the military for 15 years.</p>

<p>He has said his work gave him a close look at the way funds have been handled.&#xA0;</p>
<p><span>In a series of videos posted online,&#xA0;</span>Ali has&#xA0;<a href="/ajimpact/egyptian-contractor-targeted-sisi-allegations-190905135843139.html">accused el-Sisi and the army of wasting</a>&#xA0;millions of dollars of public money on palaces, villas and hotels.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Your time is up,&#x201D; Ali said, addressing el-Sisi in a video posted on Tuesday, telling Egyptians to go to the streets on Friday.</p>
<p>For his part, el-Sisi<span>&#xA0;</span><a href="/news/2019/09/egypt-corruption-president-el-sisi-denies-wrongdoing-190915072848667.html">told&#xA0;<span>a youth conference&#xA0;</span>last week</a> that the allegations of corruption within the army and the government were &#x201C;lies and slander&#x201D; and amounted to defamation.</p>
<h2>Viral videos</h2>
<p>Public attention shifted to Ali after he began posting videos earlier this month, accusing Egyptian officials of squandering billions of Egyptian pounds. His first video on September 2 garnered 1.7 million views on his Facebook page alone.</p>
<p>Since then, dozens of cartoons have been made in Egypt pitting him against el-Sisi, as well as images depicting Ali as another Mohamed Ali, an Ottoman-era commander who ruled Egypt in the 19th century.</p>

<p>&#x201C;Mohamed Ali is probably the most popular man in Egypt right now,&#x201D; <span>Mohamad Elmasry, chair of the media and journalism programme at the Doha Institute for Graduate Studies, told Al Jazeera</span>.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Millions of people have watched his videos, while his anti-Sisi hashtags have gone viral.</p>
<p>&#x201C;This is something that is a legitimate threat to the el-Sisi government &#x2013; if it wasn&#x2019;t a legitimate threat, then el-Sisi wouldn&#x2019;t have come out and responded directly to Mohamed Ali at last week&#x2019;s youth conference,&#x201D; said Elmasry, adding it was &#x201C;unprecedented&#x201D; for el-Sisi &#x201C;to be put on the defensive like that inside Egypt by an Egyptian&#x201D;.</p>
<h2>&#x2018;People looking for a spark&#x2019;</h2>
<p>Egypt outlawed all unauthorised demonstrations in 2013 after el-Sisi, as defence minister, led the military&#x2019;s overthrow of democratically-elected President <a href="/topics/people/mohamed-morsi.html">Mohamed Morsi</a> following mass demonstrations.</p>
<p>Since then, Egyptian authorities have imprisoned and prosecuted thousands of people, according to human rights groups, with a nationwide crackdown intensifying after el-Sisi was first elected&#xA0;<span>in 2014 with 97 percent of the vote.</span></p>
<p><span>Some Egyptian activists have warned of the dangers that protesting can have on the lives of demonstrators, given what they called a tight grip on security by authorities.</span></p>
<p><span><span>Ali has also demanded the release of all political prisoners in addition to army and police officers arrested for opposing the president. He</span><span>&#xA0;also urged security forces not to confront the protesters but to protect them.</span></span></p>
<p>El-Sisi&#x2019;s supporters say dissent must be quashed to stabilise Egypt and also credit him with economic reforms agreed with the International Monetary Fund.&#xA0;</p>
<p>The introduction of harsh austerity measures might have helped to reboot an economy battered by the 2011 <a href="/topics/subjects/arab-spring.html">Arab Spring</a> but has also resulted in the poverty rate soaring.</p>
<p>According to official statistics, released in July, one in three people in Egypt &#x2013; a country of some 100 million people, is living in poverty. Other estimates put the number much higher.</p>
<p>Elmasry said that even though Egyptians have been aware of the corruption within the government apparatus, the fact that Ali &#x201C;is an insider who worked with the military for about 15 years, that he has intricate details and also the fact that economy is spiralling out of control for the average Egyptian&#x201D; appears to have struck a chord with many disenchanted people in the country.</p>
<p>&#x201C;People &#x2026; were looking for some kind of a spark, and Mohamed Ali has given that to them.&#x201D;</p>
