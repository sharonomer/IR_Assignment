<p>On a rainy Wednesday, US President Donald Trump laid a ceremonial wreath at Arlington cemetery in commemoration of the US&#x2019;s Veterans Day as his contest of the November 3 election muddled on.</p>
<p>The president avoided speaking to reporters but kept up his tweeting, claiming &#x201C;a mountain of corruption &amp; dishonesty&#x201D; in the US election, despite lacking evidence.</p>
<p>President-elect Joe Biden laid his own wreath at a memorial in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. He also met behind closed doors in Wilmington, Delaware, with his transition team as he prepared to name his future White House aides and Cabinet officials.</p>
<p>Longtime Biden aide and campaign adviser Ron Klain is reportedly poised to become the White House chief of staff.</p>

<p>Trump&#x2019;s campaign filed a new lawsuit in federal court in Michigan, alleging irregularities in the heavily Democratic city of Detroit and asking a judge to delay certification of the vote.</p>
<p>Biden won Michigan by more than 148,000 votes, adding the state&#x2019;s 16 Electoral College votes to his winning total of 290 so far. It takes 270 electoral votes to become president.</p>
<p>A lead lawyer representing Democrats in Trump&#x2019;s election lawsuits predicted on Twitter that the president&#x2019;s latest claim would fail.</p>

<p>Trump&#x2019;s campaign filed a similar lawsuit in federal court in Pennsylvania yesterday, challenging the results of the presidential election in Democratic counties and asking a judge to prohibit certification of the results.</p>
<p>Trump plans to formally request a recount in Wisconsin next week, a state official said.</p>
<p>In Georgia, where Biden leads by 14,000 votes out of five million cast, Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger announced the state will conduct a recount by hand and a random audit of ballots.</p>
<p>&#x201C;This will help build confidence. It will be an audit, a recount and a recanvass all at once,&#x201D; Raffensperger said at a Wednesday news conference.</p>
<p>Unless numbers change in the Midwest, Georgia&#x2019;s recount will not affect the outcome of the presidential race. It can, however, influence whether Republicans or Democrats control the Senate, which will have a major effect on Biden&#x2019;s presidency.</p>
<p>Trump won Alaska, picking up three electoral votes as expected, The Associated Press reported. The state typically votes Republican.</p>
<p>Republican and Democratic election officials in 45 states have told The New York Times there is no evidence of widespread fraud or irregularities.</p>
<p>Most Republicans in Congress are continuing to at least publicly back Trump&#x2019;s claims about the election. Some have ventured to say Biden is the likely winner.</p>
<p>&#x201C;We&#x2019;re on a path, it looks likely Joe Biden is going to be the next president of the United States,&#x201D; Pennsylvania Senator Pat Toomey told a television interviewer in Pittsburgh.</p>
