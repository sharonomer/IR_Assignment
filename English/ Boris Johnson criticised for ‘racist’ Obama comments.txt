<p>London Mayor Boris Johnson has caused controversy in the United Kingdom by claiming that US President Barack Obama has an &#x201C;ancestral dislike&#x201D; for Britain as a result of his &#x201C;part-Kenyan&#x201D; heritage.</p>
<p>His comments came after Obama, on a London visit, angered proponents of a so-called Brexit by saying the <a class="internallink" href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/04/obama-eu-britain-brexit-160422042549023.html" target="_blank">UK is better off</a> by staying in the European Union.</p>
<p>In an <a href="http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/politics/7095695/UK-and-America-can-better-friends-than-ever-Mr-Obama-if-we-LEAVE-the-EU-says-Boris-Johnson.html" target="_blank"> opinion essay </a> published in the right-leaning tabloid The Sun, the mayor criticised Obama&#x2019;s eagerness to urge British voters to remain in the EU and argued that the president may be &#x201C;anti- British&#x201D;.</p>
<p>Johnson, who is seen as the unofficial leader of the campaign for the UK to leave the EU, claimed in his article that Obama removed a bust of Britain&#x2019;s war-time prime minister Sir Winston Churchill from the Oval Office shortly after he became president in 2009.</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p>I love Winston Churchill. Love the guy.</p>
			<p class="quote-author">Barack Obama</p>
		</blockquote>
		
<p>&#x201C;Some said it was a snub to Britain. Some said it was a symbol of the part-Kenyan president&#x2019;s ancestral dislike of the British empire &#x2013; of which Churchill had been such a fervent defender&#x201D; wrote the London mayor.</p>
<p>However, his remarks about Obama&#x2019;s heritage did not score Johnson any points in the EU discussions. Instead, he was branded &#x201C;racist&#x201D; by several prominent MPs.</p>
<p>Tory MP Sir Nicholas Soames, who is the grandson of Sir Winston Churchill, said Johnson&#x2019;s comments were &#x201C;appalling&#x201D; and &#x201C;totally wrong on almost everything&#x201D;.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Time and time again, his judgment is awry and he shows in this article a remarkable disregard for the facts, the truth and for all judgment,&#x201D; he told LBC radio. &#x201C;I don&#x2019;t think Boris has the stature to be leader.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Sir Nicholas also said it was inconceivable that Churchill would not have welcomed the views of Obama.</p>

<p>John McDonnell, Labour Party&#x2019;s shadow chancellor, suggested that Johnson&#x2019;s remarks were &#x201C;racist&#x201D;.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Mask slips again,&#x201D; he tweeted. &#x201C;Boris part-Kenyan Obama comment is yet another example of dog-whistle racism from senior Tories. He should withdraw it.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Support for the mayor, however, came from UKIP party leader Nigel Farage, who also campaigns for UK to leave the EU. The far-right party leader said Obama should &#x201C;butt out&#x201D;.</p>
<p>Accusing him of being the most anti-British American president in history, the far-right party leader told the Radio 4&#x2019;s World at One programme: &#x201C;I think Obama, because of his grandfather and Kenya and colonisation, I think Obama bears a bit of a grudge against this country.&#x201D;</p>
<p><strong> &#x2018;I love Churchill&#x2019; </strong></p>
<p>Obama responded to Johnson&#x2019;s comments on his alleged &#x201C;ancestral dislike&#x201D; for Britain in a press conference on Friday.</p>
<p>Talking next to British Prime Minister David Cameron, Obama said he loved Churchill and still had a bust of the British leader in his White House private residence.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Right outside the door of the Treaty Room, so that I see it every day &#x2013; including on weekends when I&#x2019;m going into that office to watch a basketball game &#x2013; the primary image I see is a bust of Winston Churchill,&#x201D; he said.</p>
<p>&#x201C;It&#x2019;s there voluntarily because I can do anything on the second floor. I love Winston Churchill. Love the guy.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Obama said there was a bust of Churchill in the Oval Office during the presidency of his predecessor George W Bush but he decided that he would have a bust of the civil rights leader Martin Luther King in his office instead.</p>
<p>&#x201C;I thought it was appropriate &#x2013; and I think most people in the United Kingdom might agree &#x2013; that as the first African-American president, it might be appropriate to have a bust of Dr Martin Luther King in my office,&#x201D; he said.</p>
