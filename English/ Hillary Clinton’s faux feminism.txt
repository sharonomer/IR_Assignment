<p><span lang="EN-GB">Last year, while researching an essay for an upcoming </span><a href="http://www.versobooks.com/books/2121-false-choices" target="_blank">collection</a><span lang="EN-GB"> titled False Choices: The Faux Feminism of Hillary Rodham Clinton, edited by Liza Featherstone, I discovered that Clinton had deleted a rather incriminating section from the paperback edition of her </span><a class="internallink" href="http://www.amazon.com/Hard-Choices-Hillary-Rodham-Clinton/dp/1476751471" target="_blank">autobiography</a><span lang="EN-GB">.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB">In the original version, she detailed the lengths to which she went as secretary of state under Barack Obama to ensure the success of the 2009 coup d&#x2019;etat in Honduras against slightly left-leaning President Manuel Zelaya.</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB">After the coup, Clinton explained, she and select regional counterparts &#x201C;strategised on a plan </span><span lang="EN-GB">to restore order in Honduras and ensure that free and fair elections could be held quickly and legitimately, which would render the question of Zelaya moot and give the Honduran people a chance to choose their own future&#x201D;.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB">Never mind that the Honduran people had already chosen Zelaya for the immediate future. In the United States&#x2019; view, apparently, opting for anything less than totally right-wing in Latin America is also a &#x201C;false choice&#x201D;.</span></p>
<h2><span lang="EN-GB">Feminist illusion</span></h2>
<p><span lang="EN-GB">As per Clinton&#x2019;s stated vision, elections were held in Honduras &#x2013; although the fact that they took place under an illegitimate coup administration naturally meant they were neither &#x201C;free&#x201D; nor &#x201C;fair&#x201D;.</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB">The indicators of the alleged democratic renaissance in Honduras, it seems, include a soaring level of impunity and wanton violations by state security forces.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB">In a 2014 </span><span><a class="internallink" href="http://america.aljazeera.com/opinions/2014/9/hillary-clinton-honduraslatinamericaforeignpolicy.html" target="_blank">op-ed</a></span><span lang="EN-GB"> for Al Jazeera America, economist Mark Weisbrot noted some additional by-products of the coup: &#x201C;</span><span lang="EN-GB">The homicide rate in Honduras, already the highest in the world, increased by 50 percent from 2008 to 2011&#x2026; Femicides skyrocketed.&#x201D;</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB">This final detail alone should do some serious damage to the marketed image of Clinton as a fervent champion of women&#x2019;s rights &#x2013; an illusion dutifully upheld by Clinton supporters who endeavour to cast the slightest opposition to the presidential hopeful as sexist and/or anti-feminist.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB">Were American political campaigns governed by reality rather than deceit, the illusion would have definitively shattered after the recent assassination of Honduran human rights and environmental activist </span><span><a class="internallink" href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/03/gunmen-murder-honduran-environmentalist-leader-160303181349473.html" target="_blank">Berta Caceres</a></span><span lang="EN-GB">.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB">As historian Greg Grandin notes in an </span><span><a href="http://www.thenation.com/article/chronicle-of-a-honduran-assassination-foretold/" target="_blank">article</a></span><span lang="EN-GB"> for <em>The </em></span><em><span lang="EN-GB">Nation</span></em><span lang="EN-GB">, Caceres had held Clinton responsible for legitimising the coup against Zelaya, and claimed that Washington was partly to blame for post-coup Honduran laws essentially criminalising political protest.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB">Grandin summarises: &#x201C;</span><span lang="EN-GB">Caceres called it &#x2018;counterinsurgency&#x2019; carried out on behalf of &#x2018;international capital&#x2019; &#x2013; mostly resource extractors &#x2013; that has terrorised the population, murdering political activists by the high hundreds.&#x201D;</span></p>

</div>
<p><span lang="EN-GB">Plenty of non-lethal repression has taken place, as well. I spent </span><span><a href="https://www.jacobinmag.com/2013/04/life-and-death-in-the-worlds-homicide-capital/" target="_blank"><span lang="EN-GB">four months in Honduras</span></a></span><span lang="EN-GB"> in the aftermath of the coup and witnessed police blast even elderly women with pepper spray-loaded </span><span lang="EN-GB">water cannons as they marched peacefully against the coup in the Honduran capital of Tegucigalpa.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB">Of course, as I point out in my essay for False Choices, it&#x2019;s not only in Honduras that Clinton&#x2019;s projected feminist orientation fails to cohere with reality.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB">Her previous support for the American war on Iraq, for one thing, certainly didn&#x2019;t translate into many rights for the Iraqi women and girls blown up, maimed, </span><span><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1340207/I-didnt-think-Iraqis-humans-says-U-S-soldier-raped-14-year-old-girl-killing-her-family.html" target="_blank">raped</a></span><span lang="EN-GB">, or otherwise made to suffer by the armed forces of the US.</span></p>
<h2><span lang="EN-GB">Democratising oppression</span></h2>
<p><span lang="EN-GB">In other areas of the Middle East, too, Clinton-advocated policies have also proven highly destructive to the lives of females &#x2013; not to mention their male counterparts.</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB">Clinton&#x2019;s takeaway from the operation, as </span><span><a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2014/08/hillary-clinton-failure-to-help-syrian-rebels-led-to-the-rise-of-isis/375832/" target="_blank">told</a></span><span lang="EN-GB"> to Jeffrey Goldberg of The Atlantic: &#x201C;I think Israel did what it had to do.&#x201D;</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB">As for Clinton-sanctioned international economic belligerence, WikiLeaks cables have </span><span><a href="http://www.thenation.com/article/wikileaks-haiti-let-them-live-3-day/" target="_blank">revealed</a></span><span lang="EN-GB"> machinations by her State Department to prevent a minimum wage increase &#x2013; to a whopping 62 cents per hour &#x2013; for Haitian assembly zone workers, including those employed by contractors for Fruit of the Loom, Hanes, and Levi&#x2019;s.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB">As I remark in False Choices: Hey, US corporations need to eat, too!</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB">None of this is to imply, however, that Clinton &#x2013; or any other individual on the American political scene &#x2013; is the problem. The real problem is the system itself, which encourages punitive policies at home and abroad in the interest of maintaining elite dominance.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB">It may be easy to argue that electing a female president would constitute a victory for democracy, equality, justice, and other terms the political class has expunged of real meaning. But while a Clinton election might indeed serve to democratise oppression, it would hardly herald progress.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB">Rather, a Clinton presidency would help to obscure the fact that, as things currently stand, the US establishment is fairly toxic not only for women but for living things in general.</span></p>
