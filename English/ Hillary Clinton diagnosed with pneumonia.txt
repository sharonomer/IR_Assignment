<p>Hillary Clinton has been diagnosed with pneumonia by her personal doctor after the US Democratic presidential candidate fell ill at a 9/11 memorial.</p>
<p>The episode has renewed focus on her health less than two months before an election.</p>
<p>The condition was diagnosed on Friday, the doctor said, but was not made public until Sunday afternoon.</p>
<p>Just hours earlier, a video was posted on social media, apparently showing Clinton stumbling and her knees buckling, before being helped by aides into a black van leaving the site of the September 11, 2001 attack in New York City.</p>
<p>She was taken to her daughter Chelsea&#x2019;s home in the city and appeared on her own about two hours later, wearing sunglasses and telling reporters that she was &#x201C;feeling great&#x201D;.</p>
<p class="ReadMoreContentSeparator"><a class="InternalLink" href="http://live.aljazeera.com/Event/US_Election_2016/" target="_blank"><strong> READ MORE: Reporter&#x2019;s Notebook &#x2013; What if Clinton or Trump were to drop out</strong></a><a class="internallink" href="http://www.aljazeera.com/blogs/americas/2016/09/donald-trump-160909160359768.html" target="_blank"></a></p>
<p>The temperature in New York was about 27C, combined with high humidity.</p>
<p>Clinton wore a high-collared shirt and a dark suit during the memorial honouring the nearly 3,000 people killed in the 9/11 attacks.</p>
<p>Democratic Congressman Joe Crowley said that it was &#x201C;stiflingly hot&#x201D;, and he himself had to leave the ceremony.</p>
<p>Clinton&#x2019;s doctor, Dr Lisa Bardack, said in a statement that her patient had been experiencing a cough related to allergies and that an examination on Friday showed it was pneumonia.</p>
<p>&#x201C;She was put on antibiotics and advised to rest and modify her schedule. While at this morning&#x2019;s event, she became overheated and dehydrated. I have just examined her and she is now re-hydrated and recovering nicely,&#x201D; Bardack said.</p>
<h2>&#x2018;Major issue&#x2019;</h2>
<p>Clinton cancelled her campaign trip to California on Monday because of her diagnosis of pneumonia.</p>
<p>Al Jazeera&#x2019;s Kimberly Halkett, reporting from Washington DC, said Clinton&#x2019;s health would now become a &#x201C;major issue&#x201D; in the lead-up to the election, &#x201C;elevated from the ranks of conspiracies to a legitimate campaign issue&#x201D;.</p>
<p>She noted that Sunday&#x2019;s event was Clinton&#x2019;s second health-related incident in a week.</p>
<p>Clinton&#x2019;s speech at a campaign rally on Labour Day in Cleveland was interrupted by a coughing spell. During the speech, she quipped: &#x201C;Every time I think about Trump I get allergic.&#x201D;</p>
<p>She then resumed her speech.</p>

<p>Republican rival Donald Trump and his supporters have been hinting at potential health issues for months, questioning Clinton&#x2019;s stamina when she takes routine days off the campaign trail and reviving questions about a concussion she sustained in December 2012 after fainting.</p>
<p>Her doctor attributed that episode to a stomach virus and dehydration.</p>
<p>Clinton&#x2019;s doctor reported that she is fully recovered from the concussion, which led to temporary double vision and discovery of a blood clot in a vein in the space between her brain and skull.</p>
<p>Clinton also has experienced deep vein thrombosis, a clot usually in the leg, and takes the blood thinner Coumadin to prevent new clots.</p>
<p>Trump attended the same event marking the 15th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks. Asked by a reporter about Clinton&#x2019;s health incident, Trump said: &#x201C;I don&#x2019;t know anything.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Past presidential candidates have released much more detailed information about their health than either Trump, 70, or Clinton, 68.</p>
