<p>&#x201C;This nation will keep watch; we will make sure that the ancient impulse of anti-Semitism never finds a home in the modern world,&#x201D; Bush said on Saturday as he campaigned in the key battleground state of Florida.</p>
<p>The state&#x2019;s Jewish population is the third largest in the world after Israel and New York.</p>
<p>The state department had opposed the legislation, saying it was unnecessary as the department already compiles such information in its annual reports on human rights and religious freedom.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Defending freedom also means disrupting the evil of anti-Semitism,&#x201D; Bush told thousands of cheering supporters in Sunrise packed into a sports arena usually used by the Florida Panthers professional ice hockey team.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Today, I signed the Global Anti-Semitism Review Act of 2004. This law permits the government to keep a record of anti-Semitic acts throughout the world, and also a record of responses to those acts,&#x201D; he said.</p>
<p><strong>Under fire</strong></p>
<p>Florida is the richest haul among the battleground states expected to decide the 2 November presidential election, with 27 electoral college votes out of the 270 needed to win.</p>

<p>Jewish voters are thought to favour Democrats historically, but the Bush campaign hopes that his strong support for Israel and aggressive outreach efforts could win a majority of Florida&#x2019;s sizeable Jewish community.</p>
<p>The state department had drawn fire for its position from Jewish groups &#x2013; which wield significant political power especially during a presidential election year &#x2013; and in September, more than 100 prominent Americans signed a letter to US Secretary of State Colin Powell saying that the stance was &#x201C;wrong&#x201D;.</p>
<p>&#x201C;The fight against anti-Semitism deserves specific, focused attention,&#x201D; said the letter which was signed by former Republican vice-presidential nominee Jack Kemp and ex-UN ambassador Jeane Kirkpatrick among others.</p>
<p>The bill, known as the Global Anti-Semitism Awareness Act, was introduced by California Democratic Representative Tom Lantos, the only Holocaust survivor in the US Congress, in response to recent acts of anti-Semitism in Europe and the Middle East.</p>
<p><strong>Special office</strong></p>
<p>Jewish groups have hailed the passage of the bill, which they said provided a new avenue to fight anti-Semitism.</p>

<p>Under the legislation, the state department will have to produce an annual report on anti-Semitism around the world and form a specific office headed by a special envoy to document anti-Semitic abuses and design strategies to combat them.</p>
<p>It requires the department to document acts of physical violence against Jews, their property, cemeteries and places of worship abroad, as well as local governments&#x2019; responses to them and take note of instances of anti-Jewish propaganda and governments&#x2019; readiness to promote unbiased school curricula.</p>
<p>By tradition, Bush, who signed the legislation on his official Air Force One jet on his way to Florida, will treat the law&#x2019;s requirements more like strong advice and guiding principles because of the separation of powers.</p>
