<p>Former President Barack Obama says he is &#x201C;troubled&#x201D; by Republicans &#x201C;going along&#x201D; with President Donald Trump&#x2019;s unsubstantiated claims of election fraud and argues it is &#x201C;delegitimising&#x201D; democracy.</p>
<p>&#x201C;They appear to be motivated, in part, because the president doesn&#x2019;t like to lose and never admits loss,&#x201D; the former president <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/barack-obama-donald-trump-election-60-minutes-2020-11-12/" target="_blank">told</a> CBS News&#x2019;s 60 Minutes in an interview to air on Sunday night.</p>
<p>&#x201C;I&#x2019;m more troubled by the fact that other Republican officials who clearly know better are going along with this, are humouring him in this fashion,&#x201D; Obama continued. &#x201C;It is one more step in delegitimising not just the incoming Biden administration, but democracy generally. And that&#x2019;s a dangerous path.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Since Joe Biden was declared president-elect on Saturday, Trump has yet to concede, as is tradition. His campaign has also filed numerous <a href="/news/2020/11/10/lawsuits-increase-as-trump-attempts-to-sue-his-way-to-victory">lawsuits</a> challenging votes and the administration of the election in several key states while also backing recounts in states such as Georgia and Wisconsin.</p>

<p>While some Republicans have <a href="/news/2020/11/12/more-world-leaders-congratulate-biden-than-us-republicans">congratulated</a> Biden and are recognising him as the next president, many have held off and instead are either outright supporting Trump&#x2019;s election challenges or urging patience as the process plays out.</p>
<p>Obama spoke to CBS to promote his new memoir, A Promised Land, which will be released on Tuesday.</p>
<p>In the book, the former president talks about why he thinks his presidency &#x2013; and his race &#x2013; were the foundation for Trump&#x2019;s own election in 2016.</p>
<p>&#x201C;It was as if my very presence in the White House had triggered a deep-seated panic, a sense that the natural order had been disrupted,&#x201D; Obama writes, according to excerpts of the book obtained by CNN.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Which is exactly what Donald Trump understood when he started peddling assertions that I had not been born in the United States and was thus an illegitimate president. For millions of Americans spooked by a Black man in the White House, he promised an elixir for their racial anxiety.&#x201D;</p>
