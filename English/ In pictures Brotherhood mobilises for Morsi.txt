<p><strong>Cairo, Egypt &#x2013;</strong> From miles away, the lights of Sunday night&#x2019;s Muslim Brotherhood rally could be seen beaming high above the downtown city skyline.</p>
<p>Thousands of supporters at Abdeen Square in central Cairo cheered, as Muslim leaders took to the stage to introduce Mohamed Morsi, considered one of the front-runners in Egypt&#x2019;s presidential race.&#xA0;It was the final event for any of the 13 candidates before a ban on any campaigning went into effect on Monday, two days before polls open on Wednesday.</p>
<p>&#x201C;God willing, Morsi will be president after the first round,&#x201D; the crowd chanted.</p>
<p>Um Hassan, a 36-year-old from Cairo, told Al Jazeera she was there &#x201C;in solidarity&#x201D; with Morsi, the candidate of the Muslim Brotherhood&#x2019;s Freedom and Justice Party. She said Egypt had been &#x201C;liberated&#x201D; after last year&#x2019;s uprising that toppled former President Hosni Mubarak.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Before the revolution, I couldn&#x2019;t open my mouth and say anything, now I can vote for the party that I want,&#x201D; she said. &#x201C;I feel liberated.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Others seemed to support the Muslim Brotherhood more than Morsi himself, who was a relative latecomer &#x2013; after the group&#x2019;s main candidate was disqualified.</p>
<p>&#x201C;They&#x2019;re not individuals,&#x201D; said 43-year-old Cairene Mohamed Said, referring to the Muslim Brotherhood&#x2019;s members. &#x201C;They&#x2019;re an entire establishment.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Yosri Abdel Wahab, from Minya in Upper Egypt, said he hadn&#x2019;t been a long time supporter of the Muslim Brotherhood, but liked Morsi because he was &#x201C;honest&#x201D;.</p>
<p>&#x201C;The country needs someone religious and pious who treats Muslims and Christians fairly,&#x201D; 50-year-old&#xA0;Abdel Wahab said.</p>
<p>Morsi finally took the stage, listing names of cities and towns across Egypt from which he said his party drew its support.</p>
<p>&#x201C;We will take a serious step towards a better future, God willing,&#x201D; he said.</p>
