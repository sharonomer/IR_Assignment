<p><span>As Egypt approaches its presidential election on Monday, voters have been left with two choices: incumbent <a href="/news/middleeast/2013/07/201373112752442652.html">Abdel Fattah el-Sisi</a>,&#xA0;the general turned president who has cracked down on challengers and dissent, or a barely known candidate.</span></p>
<p>Mousa Mostafa Mousa, 65, an Egyptian politician who emerged just in advance of the January 29 deadline as the sole contender to 63-year-old Sisi, has been avoiding the limelight and providing little evidence on streets of Cairo that he will be standing against him at all.</p>

<p> Mousa, who leads the Ghad party, had endorsed Sisi for a second term and even organised events to help nominate the former military commander up until a week before the nomination deadline.</p>
<p>His presidential bid seemed to come as a surprise even to his own party. Hours before the candidate nomination window closed, a member of his team was photographed running down a Cairo street to the elections commission to make the deadline.</p>
<p>Mousa said the late decision to run came after all other candidates withdrew. He has continuously dismissed accusations that his candidacy was being used to present a false sense of competition.</p>
<p>&#x201C;We are entering a fair and honourable competition in order to win,&#x201D; Mousa told reporters at a press conference following the announcement of his candidacy.</p>
<p><span>Since his announcement, Mousa has failed to name the 20 members of parliament who reportedly endorsed him, allowing him to enter the race. His party endorsed Sisi&#x2019;s presidential bid just 10 days before he announced his candidacy.</span></p>
<p><span>The election commission says the vote will be free and fair, but critics say Sisi has already ensured he will win a second term after seven other candidates withdrew, or were prevented from running.</span></p>

<h2><span>&#x2018;A puppet&#x2019;</span></h2>
<p><span>While Mousa has said he would mount a full challenge to Sisi, opposition activists, journalists and analysts have dismissed him as a dummy candidate, standing only to give the impression of a full democratic contest.</span></p>
<p>&#x201C;It&#x2019;s pretty obvious to observers and Egyptians alike that Mousa is a mere puppet in the election,&#x201D; an Egyptian analyst, who asked to remain anonymous for fear of repercussions, told Al Jazeera.</p>
<p>&#x201C;He heads a party that has backed Sisi in the election, so it is clear that his candidacy is for the sake of creating an image of credibility for the vote.</p>

</div>
<p><span>&#x201C;There isn&#x2019;t a single Egyptian who believes this election will be free and fair,&#x201D; added the analyst.</span></p>
<p>Egyptian political activist Salman al-Badry agreed: &#x201C;Mousa&#x2019;s candidacy only adds to the theatrical environment enveloping these elections.</p>
<p>&#x201C;His electoral plan is nothing more than pen on paper; his policies are impossible to implement in light of the economic crisis which Sisi has created in Egpyt.&#x201D;</p>
<p><span>Until the morning of his nomination, Mousa&#x2019;s Facebook page carried a portrait of the president, with the statement, &#x201C;Long Live Egypt: Abdel Fattah el-Sisi for president.&#x201D;</span></p>
<p><span>That portrait was removed after Mousa&#x2019;s candidacy was announced.</span></p>
<p>He has since told Egyptian news website Bawabat al-Ahram in February that if he were to win, he would &#x201C;seek Sisi&#x2019;s assistance in maintaining the achievements Sisi has already done&#x201D;.</p>
<p>&#x201C;My aim is to develop the country along the same path that Sisi has laid out,&#x201D; said Mousa.</p>
<p>Mousa&#x2019;s policy platform includes price controls for low-income citizens, reopening formerly shuttered factories, and a programme to fight congestion on the streets of Cairo. But he has avoided anything that could be interpreted as criticism of the president&#x2019;s previous term.</p>
<p><span>Al Jazeera contacted Mousa&#x2019;s campaign team for comment but did not receive a response at the time of publication.&#xA0;</span></p>

<h2>Opponents cleared</h2>
<p>Several leading opposition figures have called for a boycott of the election, saying repression had cleared the field of challengers and left Sisi&#x2019;s top opponent in jail.</p>

<p> The <a href="/topics/organisations/un.html">United Nations</a>, rights groups and opposition figures have also criticised the run-up as compromised by arrests, intimidation of opponents and a nomination process stacked in favour of the incumbent.</p>
<p>Egyptian authorities detained Sisi&#x2019;s final serious rival, former military chief of staff Sami Anan, <span>on January 23&#xA0;</span>shortly after he announced his candidacy. Anan was accused of illegally declaring his intention to contest the election before getting the military&#x2019;s approval.&#xA0;</p>
<p><span>Several other potential contenders either withdrew from the race &#x2013; like prominent human rights lawyer Khaled Ali and ex-Prime Minister Ahmed Shafik &#x2013; or were detained.</span></p>
<p>According to the Egyptian analyst, Mousa&#x2019;s candidacy was ordered by Sisi to create a &#x201C;semblance of credibility&#x201D; for the vote.</p>
<p><span>&#x201C;When Khaled Ali dropped out of the electoral race, Sisi was caught off guard,&#x201D; said the analyst</span></p>
<p><span>&#x201C;He had thought that Ali would run without posing a real threat, unlike Anan and Shafik, while giving an image that the elections were fair.</span></p>
<p><span>&#x201C;Mousa had no choice but to run an appear to have a plan.&#x201D;</span></p>
<p>Sisi was elected in 2014, a year after leading the army to depose President <a href="/news/2016/06/profile-egypt-deposed-president-mohamed-morsi-160607074148919.html">Mohamed Morsi</a> of the Muslim Brotherhood-affiliated Freedom and Justice Party.&#xA0;</p>
<p><span>The vote taking place from March 26-28 is the third presidential election since protests in 2011 unseated long-time ruler Hosni Mubarak.</span></p>
