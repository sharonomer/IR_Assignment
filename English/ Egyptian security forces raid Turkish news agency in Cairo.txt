<p><a href="/topics/country/turkey.html">Turkey</a>&#xA0;has summoned a senior Egyptian diplomat to protest what it said was a raid by Egyptian security forces on the Cairo office of Turkey&#x2019;s state-run news agency, in which four people were arrested.</p>
<p>The Anadolu news agency on Wednesday said the four employees, including one Turkish national, were taken to an undisclosed location after the police swoop.</p>
<p>Egyptian security forces shut down the agency&#x2019;s security cameras and internet and searched the premises overnight, the agency reported. The workers&#x2019; passports, mobile phones, and computers were confiscated, it said, adding no explanation was given to the agency&#x2019;s lawyer.</p>
<p><span>Turkey&#x2019;s foreign ministry strongly condemned the move, which it described as &#x201C;an act of violence&#x201D; against Anadolu. It also summoned the Egyptian charge d&#x2019;affaires over the matter.</span></p>
<p>&#x201C;This act of violence against Anadolu not only shows the Egyptian leadership&#x2019;s hostile stance towards the freedom of the press, but also once again shows its grave conditions on democracy and transparency,&#x201D; the ministry said.</p>
<p>It also blamed Western nations for the raid, accusing them of &#x201C;turning a blind eye&#x201D; to rights violations in <a href="/topics/country/egypt.html">Egypt</a>.</p>
<p>The ministry called on Egyptian authorities to immediately release the detained Anadolu personnel.</p>

<p>Ankara&#x2019;s ties with Cairo have been poor since the Egyptian army overthrew President <a href="/topics/people/mohamed-morsi.html">Mohamed Morsi</a>, an ally of Turkish President<a href="/topics/people/recep-tayyip-erdogan.html">&#xA0;Recep Tayyip Erdogan</a>, in 2013.

<p>The two countries have also been at odds over maritime jurisdiction and offshore resources in the eastern Mediterranean.</p>

<p>A spokesman for Egypt&#x2019;s Ministry of Interior was not immediately available for comment.</p>
<p>But an Egyptian official confirmed the arrests and accused the news agency of operating without a license.</p>
<p>Media are required to have permission to work in Egypt, but that requirement is often used as a pretext to silence reporting the state sees as critical.</p>
<p>The official, speaking on condition of anonymity under regulations, said security forces raided an apartment in the heart of Cairo that Anadolu used as a makeshift office, confiscating documents and cameras.</p>
<p>He accused two journalists of spreading news that distorted Egypt&#x2019;s image, and said prosecutors were investigating all four employees.</p>
<h2><strong>&#x2018;Putschist leadership&#x2019;</strong></h2>
<p><span>Fahrettin Altun,&#xA0;</span>Turkey&#x2019;s communications director, described the raid as a &#x201C;hostile attempt against Anadolu employees by Egypt&#x2019;s putschist leadership&#x201D;, adding Ankara called on the international community to condemn the detentions.</p>
<p>Minister of Justice Abdulhamit Gul said Turkey expected the immediate release of the employees who he said were &#x201C;illegally detained&#x201D;.</p>
<p>In recent years, Egyptian authorities have jailed dozens of Egyptian reporters and occasionally expelled foreign journalists from the country.</p>
<p>Al Jazeera&#x2019;s <a href="/news/2019/12/al-jazeera-mahmoud-hussein-held-egypt-prison-3-years-191220114733158.html">Mahmoud Hussein</a>, an Egyptian national, has been held in prison without charge for 1,118 days.</p>
<p>Egypt remains among the world&#x2019;s worst jailers of journalists, along with Turkey and <a href="/topics/country/china.html">China</a>, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ), a US-based watchdog.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Journalists operating in Egypt should not have to work in fear that they will be used to settle political scores between countries,&#x201D; said Sherif Mansour, the Middle East and North Africa programme coordinator for CPJ.</p>
<p>The group urged Egyptian authorities to release those being held and &#x201C;stop using false news charges to harass and silence the media&#x201D;.</p>
