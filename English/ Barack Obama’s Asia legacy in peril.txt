<p><span lang="EN-US">&#x201C;After a decade in which we fought two wars that cost us dearly, in blood and treasure, [we are] turning our attention to the vast potential of the Asia-Pacific region,&#x201D; United States President Barack Obama </span><a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2011/11/17/remarks-president-obama-australian-parliament" target="_blank"><span>exclaimed in a 2011</span></a><span lang="EN-US"> speech before the Australian parliament.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-US">It marked the formal commencement of the US&#x2019; much-touted &#x201C;pivot to Asia&#x201D; &#x2013; or &#x201C;rebalancing&#x201D; &#x2013;&#xA0;strategy under the Obama administration.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-US">For the US president, it wasn&#x2019;t only about decoupling from what he characterised as his predecessor&#x2019;s &#x201C;</span><a href="http://foreignpolicy.com/2015/11/11/dumb-wars-obama-afghanistan-us-military-iraq-syria/" target="_blank"><span>dumb war</span></a><span lang="EN-US">&#x201C;</span><span lang="EN-US"> legacy in the Middle East, but also tapping into the vast market potentials of the Asia-Pacific region, which has rapidly emerged as the new centre of global economic gravity.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-US">&#x201C;As the world&#x2019;s fastest-growing region &#x2013; and home to more than half the global economy &#x2013; the Asia-Pacific is critical to achieving my highest priority, and that&#x2019;s creating jobs and opportunity for the American people,&#x201D; he continued. It didn&#x2019;t take long before Obama transformed this expression of primary strategic interest into concrete policy.</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-US">Under the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) agreement, Washington aimed to create a gargantuan free-trade area among the world&#x2019;s leading and most promising economies.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-US">But there was also an element of strategic urgency. Cognisant of China&#x2019;s rising economic influence and maritime assertiveness in Asia, the Obama administration was intent on countering what they perceived as a direct challenge to the US hegemony in the Indo-Pacific theatre.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-US">Five years on, the Obama administration is heading into its sunset amid </span><a href="http://www.nasdaq.com/article/diminishing-prospects-for-transpacific-partnership-cloud-obama-goals-20160823-00866" target="_blank"><span>spirited domestic opposition</span></a><span lang="EN-US">, across the ideological spectrum, to greater US integration into global markets. More fundamentally, what is at stake is no less than US primacy in Asia.</span></p>
<h2><strong><span lang="EN-US">The American Century</span></strong></h2>
<p><span lang="EN-US">For the past century, a cocktail of naval prowess and free-trade ideology has undergirded the US foreign policy interest.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-US">Since the end of World War II, which saw the massive destruction of industrial powers in Europe and Asia (Japan), the US navy has guarded international waters; American companies have dominated the global investment and innovation landscape; and US-led international organisations such as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund have revamped the economic regimes of almost every nation on earth.</span></p>
		<blockquote>
			<p>There is palpable perception that economic globalisation only benefits major American companies and labour-intensive Asian economies, exposing ordinary workers as well as small and medium enterprises in the West to vicious Darwinian competition from without.</p>
			<p class="quote-author"> </p>
		</blockquote>
		
<p><span lang="EN-US">The 2007-08 Great Recession and its aftershocks, however, have massively undermined the US hyperpower, reducing it to an often whimpering, slackened goliath.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-US">Or, at least, that is how the US has been </span><a href="http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Southeast_Asia/SEA-01-111013.html" target="_blank"><span>increasingly perceived</span></a><span lang="EN-US"> by many of its allies and nemeses in recent years.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-US">Confronting deepening doubts over the US&#x2019; wherewithal as the supposed anchor of stability and prosperity in critical regions, the Obama administration, in former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton&#x2019;s words, </span><a href="http://foreignpolicy.com/2011/10/11/americas-pacific-century/" target="_blank"><span>promised</span></a><span lang="EN-US"> &#x201C;</span><span lang="EN-US">a substantially increased investment &#x2013; diplomatic, economic, strategic, and otherwise &#x2013; in the Asia-Pacific region&#x201D;. It had to offer more than hollow rhetoric.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-US">The TPP, vigorously pushed by Obama and former Secretary of State Clinton, is a &#x201C;high-standard&#x201D; trade liberalisation scheme </span><span><a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/02/trans-pacific-partnership-perspective-160204161924411.html" target="_blank">aimed</a>&#xA0;</span><span lang="EN-US">at reducing barriers to foreign investment in the emerging markets of Asia, removal of non-tariff restrictions on imports, streamlining of the public sector via aggressive privatisation, and empowerment of multinational companies to protect their assets against sovereign governments&#x2019; appropriation.</span></p>

<p>It represented the centrepiece of the Obama administration&#x2019;s efforts to re-assert US primacy in Asia and expand trade and investment opportunities for American capital abroad.</p>
<p><span lang="EN-US">For Washington, this was a win-win deal &#x2013; facilitating American economic rebound and diffusion of technology between developed and emerging markets.<a href="https://wikileaks.org/tpp-ip3/"></a></span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-US"><a href="https://wikileaks.org/tpp-ip3/" target="_blank">Thanks to leaked documents</a></span><span lang="EN-US">, it soon became clear to many that the TPP </span><a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/02/trans-pacific-partnership-perspective-160204161924411.html" target="_blank"><span>could excessively empower</span></a><span lang="EN-US"> big capital at the expense of public interest as well as undermine sovereign prerogative of developing countries.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-US">But Asian partners, from Malaysia to Vietnam and Singapore, stood their ground, putting up a determined resistance against domestic public pressure.</span></p>
<h2><strong><span lang="EN-US">Anti-globalisation populism</span></strong></h2>
<p><span lang="EN-US">Interestingly, the agreement proved also controversial in the developed world, particularly in the US, where leading presidential candidates vehemently opposed the mega-trade agreement.</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://feelthebern.org/bernie-sanders-on-trade/" target="_blank">To Bernie Sanders</a>&#xA0;</span><span lang="EN-US">and his supporters, the deal represented a disastrous trade agreement &#x201C;designed to protect the interests of the largest multinational corporations at the expense of workers, consumers, the environment and the foundations of American democracy&#x201D;.</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-US">Desperate to leave behind a concrete legacy in Asia, Obama is embarking </span><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/22/business/international/trans-pacific-partnership-obama.html" target="_blank"><span>on his final, lonely pitch</span></a><span lang="EN-US"> in favour of the controversial trade agreement.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-US">But it is unlikely that he will succeed in overcoming profound public scepticism over further economic liberalisation, as populism and anti-elite sentiments dominate the US elections.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-US">It seems Obama&#x2019;s efforts to enhance the US influence in Asia only evinced the depth of domestic ideological and socioeconomic faultlines, while driving home the collapsing appeal of globalisation among the demos.</span></p>
