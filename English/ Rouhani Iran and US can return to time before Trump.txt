<p><strong>Tehran, Iran</strong> &#x2013; Iran and the United States can fully reverse four years of Donald Trump and return to conditions before his presidency, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani has said.</p>
<p>In a televised cabinet speech on Wednesday, Rouhani said if the incoming Joe Biden administration has the political will, Iran-US relations could be very different.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Iran and the US can both decide and announce that they will return to conditions on January 20, 2017,&#x201D; he said.</p>
<p>&#x201C;This can be a great solution to a large number of issues and completely change the path and conditions.&#x201D;</p>
<p>However, Rouhani outlined what Iran would expect of future President Biden.</p>
<p>&#x201C;We hope that in its first steps, the next US administration will explicitly condemn Trump&#x2019;s policies on Iran,&#x201D; the president said, calling the policies &#x201C;anti-human rights and terroristic&#x201D;.</p>
<p>He also said a Biden administration would have to &#x201C;make up for the incorrect policies&#x201D; of his predecessor without further elaborating.</p>

<p>The president said Iran&#x2019;s policy has always been clear and is based on &#x201C;commitment for commitment, action for action, de-escalation for de-escalation, and respect for respect&#x201D;.</p>
<p>In May 2018, Trump unilaterally withdrew from a landmark nuclear deal reached between Iran and world powers in 2015 and imposed harsh economic sanctions on Tehran.</p>
<p>The sanctions only intensified as Iran started battling the deadliest outbreak COVID-19 pandemic of the Middle East, which has now killed nearly 50,000 people.</p>
<p>Iran has called the &#x201C;maximum pressure&#x201D; campaign of the Trump administration an instance of &#x201C;economic and medical terrorism&#x201D;, and has said a future US administration would have to pay compensation.</p>
<h2>&#x2018;End of Trumpism&#x2019;</h2>
<p>The Iranian president on Wednesday also said the defeat of Trump in the US presidential elections signals that Iranians emerged victorious from an &#x201C;economic war&#x201D;.</p>
<p>&#x201C;One of the great manifestations of the victory of the Iranian nation and the certain defeat of the enemy in this economic war is the end of the Trumpism era,&#x201D; Rouhani said.</p>
<p>&#x201C;This person committed the worst crimes in US history against independent nations, especially the Iranian and Palestinian nations.&#x201D;</p>
<p>According to Rouhani, the past three years signal a new &#x201C;holy defence&#x201D; only second to the deadly eight-year Iran-Iraq War that ended in 1988.</p>
<p>In both wars, he said, Iran stood alone while foes supported from both the West and the east attacked.</p>
<p>Rouhani&#x2019;s remarks come one day after Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said Iran will resist and choose the path of &#x201C;defusing sanctions and overcoming them&#x201D; until a time when countries that target Iran come to the realisation that sanctions are useless.</p>
<p>&#x201C;We tried the path of lifting sanctions once and negotiated for years, but it led to no results,&#x201D; Khamenei said.</p>
<p>&#x201C;If we can overcome sanctions through hard work and innovation and taking problems as they come, and the other side sees that sanctions are ineffective, they will gradually stop sanctioning.&#x201D;</p>
