<p>Wael Ghonim, one of the icons of Egypt&#x2019;s landmark 2011 anti-government protests, has appeared in a series of videos in which he has asked President <a href="/topics/people/abdel-fattah-el-sisi.html">Abdel Fattah el-Sisi</a> to &#x201C;repent and seek forgiveness&#x201D; from the widow of late leader&#xA0;<a href="/topics/people/mohamed-morsi.html">Mohamed Morsi</a>.</p>
<p>Morsi, Egypt&#x2019;s first democratically elected president,&#xA0;<a href="/news/2019/06/egypt-president-mohamed-morsi-dies-state-media-190617155322012.html">died on June 17</a>&#xA0;this year after he collapsed in the court during his trial for espionage &#x2013; charges that he and his supporters said were politically motivated.</p>
<p>After only a year in power, Morsi was deposed in a 2013 military coup carried out by el-Sisi.</p>

<p>In the videos posted on his Facebook page on Tuesday, Ghonim, 38, asked el-Sisi to reach out to Morsi&#x2019;s widow, <a href="/news/middleeast/2013/08/201388141040988659.html">Naglaa Mahmoud</a>, and repent.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Sisi, if you have any shame, go to this lady and kiss her hands, and prove to us that you have shame and that your mother raised you well,&#x201D; said a frail-looking Ghonim,&#xA0;<span>who appeared to have shaved his head moments before the videos were shot.</span></p>
<p>&#x201C;If you don&#x2019;t do this, it&#x2019;ll mean that your mother failed at her job. If she was alive, she would&#x2019;ve told you that what you&#x2019;re doing is wrong.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Ghonim said he regretted that nobody had cared to ask how Mahmoud must have felt after <a href="/news/2019/09/morsi-son-abdullah-dies-heart-attack-cairo-hospital-190905065226988.html">losing&#xA0;her youngest son</a> Abdullah Morsi to a heart attack last month.&#xA0;</p>

<p>A former Google executive, Ghonim rose to prominence in 2011 as one of the administrators of the Facebook page, We are all Khaled Said, named after a young Egyptian tortured to death by the security forces while in custody.&#xA0;</p>
<p>Ghonim disappeared on January 28, 2011, at the height of popular demonstrations against the then Egyptian President <a href="/topics/people/hosni-mubarak.html">Hosni Mubarak</a>.</p>
<p>After his employer, family and friends mounted a desperate campaign to trace him, it was found several days later that he had been detained by the security forces.</p>

<p>Released after 11 days, Ghonim went on to write, Revolution 2.0: A Book, detailing the harrowing experiences of being kept blindfolded for the duration of his detainment and the exhilaration of being a part of his country&#x2019;s push for change.&#xA0;</p>
<p>In one of the videos, Ghonim accuses Egyptian contractor Mohamed Ali, el-Sisi&#x2019;s relative who recently spoke out against <a href="/topics/issues/corruption.html">corruption</a> in the army, of doing so &#x201C;for money&#x201D;.&#xA0;&#xA0;</p>
<p>Ali had recently&#xA0;<a href="/ajimpact/egyptian-contractor-targeted-sisi-allegations-190905135843139.html">alleged</a> that el-Sisi, his wife Intisar, Transport Minister Major General Kamel al-Wazir and several other military officials stole money from the construction companies working with the army, including his own.</p>
<p>El-Sisi or the Egyptian government have yet to respond to Ghonim&#x2019;s video messages.</p>
