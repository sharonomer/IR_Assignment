<p><span style="font-family:inherit;font-size:13px">When during his speech at the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) summit in Tehran the Egyptian President Mohamed Morsi declared it an &#x201C;ethical duty&#x201D; to support the Syrian people against the &#x201C;oppressive regime&#x201D; of Bashar al-Assad in Damascus suddenly, for a clear moment, he became the messenger of the Egyptian Revolution for the Syrian people, and by extension for the rest of the Arab and Muslim world &#x2013; that Egyptians as a liberated nation stand with them.</span>&#xA0;</p>
<p><span style="font-family:inherit;font-size:13px">The utterance, in and of itself, suddenly placed Egypt as the leader of the potentially free and democratic Arab and Muslim world &#x2013; dismantling the old clich&#xE9; of the US as the self-designated &#x201C;leader of the free world&#x201D;. &#xA0;&#xA0;</span>&#xA0;</p>
<p><span style="font-family:inherit;font-size:13px">Morsi spoke with a presiding authority that stems from no religious conviction, but from a moral imperative that only a liberated nation can momentarily invest on their elected officials. For a moment &#x2013; and may that moment be extended into the rest of our history &#x2013; the flower of the Egyptian revolution had an aroma pleasing to the world at large.&#xA0;</span>&#xA0;</p>
<p><span style="font-family:inherit;font-size:13px">Those very simple sentences suddenly dismantled a nasty binary &#x2013; that if you spoke on behalf of the Syrian people then you had sided with the US-Saudi-Qatari design for the region, and if you criticised that design, then you had sided with the criminal Syrian regime. Morsi spoke from within that false binary and dislodged it.&#xA0;</span>&#xA0;</p>
<p><span style="font-family:inherit;font-size:13px">Much remains to be seen and much remains to unfold in the Egyptian revolution. The US and its regional allies are dead set to derail the Egyptian revolution to their benefits. But certainly as the fruit of that revolution (so far) and the result of the first ever free and democratic election in Egyptian history, President Morsi gave a clear and undiluted message to the Syrian people.</span>&#xA0;</p>
<p><span style="font-family:inherit;font-size:13px">This is not to say that the regional abuse of the manufactured sectarian violence in Syria by the US, Israel and the Saudis on one side, and Russia, China and Iran on the other, is to be disregarded. But with all its uncertainties, Egypt has emerged as a moral voice from the heart of its revolution and as such it is a force that Morsi&#x2019;s speech in Tehran made abundantly clear.&#xA0;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family:inherit;font-size:13px">Beyond anything that any other country or political figure could do, President Morsi&#x2019;s speech dismantled the entire propaganda machinery of the Islamic Republic, forced its official news agencies deliberately to mistranslate his words, replace the &#x201C;Syrian government&#x201D; for where Morsi had said &#x201C;Syrian people&#x201D;, and prompted a walkout by the Syrians delegation.</span>&#xA0;</p>
<p><span style="font-family:inherit;font-size:13px">The incident so paralysed the inept propaganda apparatus of the Islamic Republic that one official attributed the walkout to the call of nature &#x2013; &#x201C;they had to go the bathroom,&#x201D; he surmised.&#xA0;</span>&#xA0;</p>
<p><span style="font-family:inherit;font-size:13px">Morsi&#x2019;s statement reverberated from Tehran to the rest of the Muslim world: &#x201C;Our solidarity with the struggle of the Syrian people,&#x201D; he said <a class="internallink" href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2012/08/20128308579560767.html" target="_blank">according to Al Jazeera</a>, &#x201C;against an oppressive regime that has lost its legitimacy is an ethical duty as it is a political and strategic necessity.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span>&#xA0;</p>
<p><span style="font-family:inherit;font-size:13px">He declared: &#x201C;We all have to announce our full solidarity with the struggle of those seeking freedom and justice in Syria, and translate this sympathy into a clear political vision that supports a peaceful transition to a democratic system of rule that reflects the demands of the Syrian people for freedom.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span>&#xA0;</p>
<p><span style="font-family:inherit;font-size:13px"><strong>Two nations at two moments&#xA0;</strong></span><span style="font-family:inherit;font-size:13px">&#xA0;</span>&#xA0;</p>
<p><span style="font-family:inherit;font-size:13px">Morsi&#x2019;s visit to Iran happened at a time that the two nations are at two vastly different time zones: Egypt has just emerged triumphantly (however tenuously) from a vastly popular revolution, and Iran is still in the claws of a deeply totalitarian regime that has managed to damage control its own democratic uprising in the form of the Green Movement. The encounter is historically instructive.&#xA0;</span><span style="font-family:inherit;font-size:13px">&#xA0;</span>&#xA0;</p>
<p><span style="font-family:inherit;font-size:13px">First and foremost, the visit exposed the utterly delusional disposition of Ali Khamenei, the Supreme Leader of the Islamic Republic, who has called the Arab Spring an &#x201C;Islamic Awakening&#x201D;. </span><span style="font-family:inherit;font-size:13px">&#xA0;</span><span style="font-family:inherit;font-size:13px">&#xA0;</span>&#xA0;</p>
<p><span style="font-family:inherit;font-size:13px">The obvious question on many people&#x2019;s mind is whether or not after this historic visit Iran and Egypt will resume their diplomatic relations, severed ever since the late Sadat offered the late Shah haven to pass his final days in peace.</span><span style="font-family:inherit;font-size:13px">&#xA0;</span>&#xA0;</p>
<p><span style="font-family:inherit;font-size:13px">But far more necessary than the full diplomatic relations is the necessity of society-to-society relationship that can be vastly beneficial to both nations &#x2013; Iranians have much to tell Egyptians at how to safeguard their revolution against ideological totalitarianism of one sort or another &#x2013; while Egyptians can be the voice of the repressed democratic aspirations in Iran. Here, President Morsi fell well short of what he could have done. Why? &#xA0;&#xA0;</span><span style="font-family:inherit;font-size:13px"><strong><em><span style="color:red">&#xA0;</span></em></strong></span>&#xA0;</p>

<p><span style="color:#262626;font-family:inherit;font-size:13px">This rise of Egypt as a leader of the free Arab and Muslim world has only one hole in it, a small hole, the size of a small island: Bahrain.&#xA0;</span></p>

<p><span style="color:#262626;font-family:inherit;font-size:13px">The Bahraini officials have asked for an apology from Iran &#x2013; while President Morsi&#x2019;s aides have categorically denied any mention of Bahrain in his speech and corroborated the charge that Iranian officials have deliberately misled and lied in their report of Morsi&#x2019;s speech on their official news agencies.&#xA0;</span><span style="font-family:inherit;font-size:13px">&#xA0;</span>&#xA0;</p>
<p><span style="color:#262626;font-family:inherit;font-size:13px">But the fact that the Islamic Republic has tried in vain to distort President Morsi&#x2019;s speech to suit its own purpose does not discount the more honest question that Bahrainis themselves may ask (and have asked) the Egyptian President &#x2013; indeed why should he not speak on their behalf with the same moral authority he did about the Syrians?&#xA0;</span><span style="font-family:inherit;font-size:13px">&#xA0;</span>&#xA0;</p>
<p><span style="color:#262626;font-family:inherit;font-size:13px">In fact, forget about using the occasion of the NAM conference to talk about the Bahraini uprising. How about simply allowing Bahraini activist into Egypt? &#xA0;</span><span style="font-family:inherit;font-size:13px">&#xA0;</span>&#xA0;</p>
<p><span style="font-family:inherit;font-size:13px"><span style="color:#262626">The prominent Bahraini activist Maryam Al-Khawaja has recently written to President Morsi complaining that she and other Bahraini activists have been denied entry into Egypt.

<p><span style="color:#262626;font-family:inherit;font-size:13px">Maryam Al-Khawaja, who is the acting president of the Bahrain Centre for Human Rights, was refused entry into Egypt when security officials told her that was because of &#x201C;top security reasons&#x201D;.

<p><span style="color:#262626;font-family:inherit;font-size:13px">Maryam Al-Khawaja has written to President Morsi &#x2013; and this is what she wrote: &#x201C;How can such blatant disregard for the law and basic human dignities continue under your watch?&#x201D; This is no longer the corrupt officials of the Islamic Republic mistranslating Morsi&#x2019;s speech. This is a Bahraini human rights activist &#x2013; equally deserving dignity of the Egyptian people&#x2019;s support.&#xA0;</span><span style="font-family:inherit;font-size:13px">&#xA0;</span>&#xA0;</p>
<p><span style="color:#262626;font-family:inherit;font-size:13px">Maryam Al-Khawaja eventually travelled to South Africa without entering Egypt. According to BBC News, &#x201C;She was denied entry into Egypt initially in April, but was later allowed in after lawyers intervened. She said in her letter that security officials told her she was allowed in then because they were protests in Egypt at the time, and authorities apparently feared a backlash if she were turned away.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span style="font-family:inherit;font-size:13px">&#xA0;</span>&#xA0;</p>
<p><span style="font-family:inherit;font-size:13px"><span style="color:#262626">What is even worse is that &#x201C;Al-Khawaja&#x2019;s colleague Nabeel Rajab was denied entry into Egypt and deported back to Bahrain.

<p><span style="font-family:inherit;font-size:13px">President Morsi&#x2019;s visits to China and Iran seem to point to the emergence of a regional and global role for Egypt as a newly liberated nation. Morsi has called for the creation of a regional group consisting of Turkey, Iran, Saudi Arabia and Egypt to help resolve the Syrian crisis.</span>&#xA0;</p>
<p><span style="font-family:inherit;font-size:13px">This is decidedly against the US-led initiative in the region. This is necessary but not sufficient &#x2013; unless and until the cause of liberty evident in Egypt and Turkey are equally extended to the two tyrannical regimes of Iran and Saudi Arabia.&#xA0;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:inherit;font-size:13px">In this regard, it is important to look at other parts of Morsi&#x2019;s speech, the parts that have been by and large disregarded. &#x201C;Now we are all facing grave challenges confronted by our member states,&#x201D; he said, <a class="internallink" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/31/world/middleeast/selected-excerpts-of-president-mohamed-morsis-speech.html?pagewanted=all" target="_blank">according to a translated transcript by the <em>New York Times</em></a>, about the Non-Aligned Movement.</span>&#xA0;&#xA0;</p>
<p><span style="font-family:inherit;font-size:13px">He mentioned Palestinians at the same breath when he cited the Syrians: &#x201C;The Palestinian and Syrian people are currently struggling with impressive valiance in calling for freedom, justice and human dignity.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span>&#xA0;</p>
<p><span style="font-family:inherit;font-size:13px">Morsi provided a vision of the role of Egypt in world affairs, with a clear awareness of the colonial and post-colonial histories: &#x201C;&#x2026; The fate of the Non-Aligned Movement is to play a pivotal role in these critical moments. The foundation of the movement came in the prime of the cold war and in the light of the struggle of colonised peoples at the time to acquire its independence and sovereignty.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span style="font-family:inherit;font-size:13px">&#xA0;</span>&#xA0;</p>
<p><span style="font-family:inherit;font-size:13px">He called for the creation of a &#x201C;just world&#x201D; and he declared &#x2013; in fact echoing Ali Khamenei &#x2013; that &#x201C;the first step of accomplishing this goal is comprehensively reforming and broadening the Security Council; reforming and broadening the Security Council comprehensively to be more representative of the established international system in the 21st century rather than a reflection of how things used to be &#x2026; during the past century.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span style="font-family:inherit;font-size:13px">&#xA0;</span>&#xA0;</p>
<p><span style="font-family:inherit;font-size:13px">He was particularly mindful of Africa: &#x201C;It&#x2019;s no longer acceptable, for example, to continue the historic injustice done to Africa, with no representation in the permanent membership category in the Security Council, and only weak representation in the non-permanent membership category, even though many of the issues on the agenda of the Council concern the states of the African continent.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span style="font-family:inherit;font-size:13px">&#xA0;</span>&#xA0;</p>
<p><span style="font-family:inherit;font-size:13px">This is a remarkable angle on the potential significance of Egypt for the African continent.&#xA0;</span><span style="font-family:inherit;font-size:13px">&#xA0;</span>&#xA0;</p>
<p><span style="font-family:inherit;font-size:13px">There is indeed much hope that one can safely place in the future of Egypt for a free and democratic Arab and Muslim world and beyond &#x2013; but only if the petty sectarian quarrels execrated by a nasty history of colonialism are not allowed to facilitate the disfiguring power of Saudi potentates to decide the democratic aspirations of so many valiant nations &#x2013; including that of Saudi Arabia who may also dream of their own share of the Arab Spring. &#xA0; &#xA0;</span>&#xA0;</p>
