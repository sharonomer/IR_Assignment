<p>A&#xA0;court in Cairo has adjourned the final ruling on a death sentence recommendation for former president Mohamed Morsi.</p>
<p>The judge in the case postponed the verdict until June 16.</p>
<p>Morsi entered the courtroom for the hearing on his death sentence on Tuesday as fellow defendants chanted with &#x201C;down, down with the military&#x201D;.</p>
<p>An Egypt court sentenced Morsi to death on May 17 for a mass prison break in 2011, prompting immediate condemnations from rights groups and world leaders.</p>
<p>The court ruled that the sentencing of Morsi and 105 others will be referred to the grand mufti, the highest religious authority in Egypt, for confirmation.</p>
<p>Egyptian authorities have banned Morsi&#x2019;s Muslim Brotherhood since his overthrow and arrested thousands of his supporters.</p>
<p>In April, a court sentenced Morsi and 12 other defendants to 20 years in prison for ordering the arrest and torture of protesters in clashes outside the presidential palace in December 2012.</p>
