<p>A lawyer has filed a complaint against a contractor who made explosive allegations against Egyptian President <a href="/topics/people/abdel-fattah-el-sisi.html">Abdel Fattah el-Sisi</a> and military officials.</p>
<p>The New Arab reported on Wednesday that Mohammed Hamed Salem had filed a complaint with Egypt&#x2019;s Attorney General Nabil Sadek accusing contractor Mohamed Ali of &#x201C;high treason&#x201D; and &#x201C;spreading false news to mislead public opinion&#x201D;.&#xA0;</p>
<p>On Tuesday, Mohamed Ali, who said he worked with the army for 15 years, posted a video to his Facebook page, accusing el-Sisi, his wife and a number of officials of squandering public funds on vanity projects while Egypt&#x2019;s poverty rate soars.</p>
<p><span>The video went viral but has reportedly since been taken down.&#xA0;</span></p>
<p>A day later, while Ali was broadcasting a second message on Facebook, his father, Ahmed Moussa, appeared on state-affiliated television accusing his son of lying and contradicting Ali&#x2019;s claim that he was owed $13.3m by the military.&#xA0;&#xA0;</p>
<p>Ali has alleged that el-Sisi, his wife Intisar, the Transport Minister Major General Kamel al-Wazir and several other military officials stole money from construction companies working with the army, including his own.&#xA0;</p>
<p>He claims he was commissioned by a brigade army officer to build a five-star hotel in a remote area of Cairo with no nearby tourist destinations, as well as being rushed by army commanders to construct a palace for el-Sisi in Alexandria because the president and his wife had decided to spend the Muslim holiday of Eid there.&#xA0;</p>
<p>Ali alleges that the Engineering Authority of the armed forces directly assigns projects to companies, rather than through tender, and expects them to start work without payment.</p>
<p><span>In the second video, Ali criticised allegations made against him, including that he was a sympathiser of the&#xA0; Muslim Brotherhood, a banned group, and that he had fled Egypt with millions.</span></p>
<p>Ali posted the videos from Spain, where he has emigrated and said he is living in fear for his family&#x2019;s safety.</p>
<p>A series of megaprojects has been approved under el-Sisi, including the <a href="/news/2015/03/egypt-plans-capital-adjacent-cairo-150314014400946.html">construction of a new capital</a> adjacent to Cairo, intended to alleviate the capital&#x2019;s congestion and overcrowding, and a mammoth redevelopment of the Suez Canal.</p>
<p>At the same time, austerity measures introduced when el-Sisi came to power in 2014, helped reboot an economy battered by the 2011 Arab Spring, but the poverty rate has soared.&#xA0;</p>
<p>According to official statistics, released by in July, one in three Egyptians is living in poverty.&#xA0;</p>
<p>An investigation by Reuters news agency estimated that Egypt&#x2019;s armed forces control about 3 percent of Egypt&#x2019;s gross domestic product and have stakes in a variety of businesses.</p>
