<p><span>Abdel Fattah el-Sisi has promised to &#x201C;care for the interests of the people&#x201D; and build a stronger Egypt as he was sworn in as the country&#x2019;s new president.</span></p>
<p>The former army chief took the oath of office at the Constitutional Court in a suburb south of the Egyptian capital Cairo, the same&#xA0;venue where Mohamed Morsi, the president who he deposed, was&#xA0;sworn in two years ago.</p>
<p>&#x201C;I swear by almighty God to preserve the republican system, and to respect the constitution and the law and to care for the interests of the people; and to preserve the independence of the nation and its territorial integrity,&#x201D; Sisi said.</p>
<p>&#x201C;We will solve the problems of the past and build an Egypt of the future &#x2026; Let our&#xA0;differences be the source of enrichment, diversity and giving that add the&#xA0;spirit of cooperation and love to our work.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Sisi is the fifth Egyptian president to come from the army&#x2019;s ranks. The ceremony also marked the first time one president handed power to the next, although Adly Mansour, the former interim president, was appointed by Sisi.</p>
<p>Sunday was declared a national holiday and tight security was enforced by&#xA0;the police and military throughout Cairo.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Cairo has announced a state of emergency across its institutions, and no breaks will be taken today and on Sunday,&#x201D; Ahmed Sakr, the deputy governor of Cairo, said on Saturday.&#xA0;</p>
<p>Sisi was&#xA0;<a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2014/06/sisi-declared-as-egypt-next-president-201463164334989432.html">declared the country&#x2019;s president</a>&#xA0;last week after winning 96.6 percent of the presidential vote, beating the only other contender, Hamdeen Sabahi, who won 3.09 percent.</p>
<p>Several regional heads of state were among those who attended the ceremony.</p>
<p><strong>Strong president</strong></p>
<p>Fawaz Gerges, a&#xA0;professor of international relations at the London School of Economics, said that a strong president would be welcomed by many Egyptians who are tired of the upheaval of the last four years.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Many Egyptians are exhausted. Forty percent live in poverty. They want stability and that is why they voted for Sisi.&#x201D;</p>
<p>An Egyptian court on Saturday&#xA0;<a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2014/06/egypt-brotherhood-members-get-death-sentences-201467174534910897.html">sentenced 10 Muslim Brotherhood supporters to death</a>&#xA0;in absentia on charges including inciting violence after the army toppled Morsi last July.</p>
<div>The same court on Saturday postponed until July 5&#xA0;a verdict in the trial of the Brotherhood&#x2019;s leader, Mohamed Badie, and scores of others for inciting violence.</div>
<p>Badie is being tried in nearly 40 cases, all of which potentially carry the death penalty, and has already been&#xA0;<a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2014/04/egypt-court-sentences-683-people-death-201442873249787688.html">sentenced to death in one case</a>.</p>
<p>Asraf Abdul Ghaffar, a senior member of the Brotherhood, told Al Jazeera that he believed many in Egypt did not recognise Sisi&#x2019;s presidency.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Sisi is not the president. Morsi has not resigned. The legitimate president is Mohamed Morsi,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;Sisi has cracked the Egyptian community.&#x201D;</p>
