<p>International organisations including the UN and African Union, politicians and people from African countries and Caribbeans are outraged over US President <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/topics/people/donald-trump.html">Donald Trump</a>&#x2018;s latest racist remarks.</p>
<p>The president criticised immigration to his country from <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/el-salvador.html">El Salvador</a>, Haiti and the African continent, by calling the group &#x201C;shithole countries&#x201D;, according to the US media.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Why are we having all these people from shithole countries come here?&#x201D; Trump asked at a meeting with congress members at the White House, reports said on Thursday, citing people with knowledge on the conversation.</p>
<p>Trump suggested the <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/united-states.html">US</a> should instead focus its immigrant entry policy on countries such as Norway.&#xA0;</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p>These are racist comments. He has said things like this before when he talked about Nigerians who won&apos;t go back to live in huts and he talked about Haitians who bring AIDS to the United States. These are all confirmations of what a lot of people have long suspected - that he harbours racism</p>
			<p class="quote-author">Bill Schneider, Washington, DC-based political analyst  </p>
		</blockquote>
		
<p>Rupert Colville, spokesman of the UN human rights office, said: &#x201C;You cannot dismiss entire countries and continents as shitholes &#x2026;&#xA0;I&#x2019;m sorry, but there&#x2019;s no other word one can use but racist.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Colville added the story wasn&#x2019;t &#x201C;just a story about vulgar language, it&#x2019;s about opening the door to humanity&#x2019;s worst side&#x201D;.</p>
<p>The African Union said it was &#x201C;frankly alarmed&#x201D;.&#xA0;</p>
<p><span>&#x201C;Given the historical reality of how many Africans arrived in the United States as slaves, this statement flies in the face of all accepted behaviour and practice,&#x201D; said AU spokeswoman Ebba Kalondo.</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/haiti.html">Haiti</a>&#x2018;s government said Trump&#x2019;s reported comments shows a &#x201C;racist view of the Haitian community&#x201D;, while <span>El Salvador sent a formal letter of protest to the US saying Trump&#xA0;</span><span>had &#x201C;implicitly&#x201D; accepted the use of &#x201C;harsh terms detrimental to the dignity of El Salvador and other countries&#x201D;.&#xA0;</span>&#xA0;</span></p>
<h2><span>Tough language&#xA0;</span></h2>
<p>Trump denied the racist remarks, tweeting on Friday that the language he used &#x201C;was tough, but this was not the language used&#x201D;, as he called for a &#x201C;merit-based system of immigration and people who take our country to the next level&#x201D;.</p>
<p>He later tweeted that he has &#x201C;never said anything derogatory about Haitians other than Haiti is, obviously a very poor and troubled country&#x201D;.&#xA0;</p>
<p>But Dick Durbin, a Democratic senator who attended the meeting, disputed Trump&#x2019;s account.&#xA0;</p>
<p>&#x201C;He said these hate-filled things and he said them repeatedly,&#x201D; Durbin told reporters.&#xA0;</p>
<p>Trump questioned why the US should accept more immigrants from Haiti, Durbin said, adding that &#x201C;shitholes&#x201D; was the &#x201C;exact word&#x201D; the US leader used to describe countries in Africa.&#xA0;</p>
<p>The White House did not directly challenge the authenticity of Trump&#x2019;s comments, but issued a statement saying: &#x201C;Certain Washington politicians choose to fight for foreign countries, but President Trump will always fight for the American people.&#x201D;</p>
<h2><span>&#x2018;Extremely offensive&#x2019;</span></h2>
<p>Rene Civil, an activist in Haiti, said that Trump is &#x201C;destabilising, a president who uses vulgar words, who is unacceptable&#x201D;.&#xA0;</p>
<p><span>Civil added: &#x201C;We [Haitians] demand that Donald Trump apologise [to] the entire African continent, as well as before Haiti, a country whose blood has been used by ancestors who have used their minds and bodies to liberate the United States itself from slavery&#x201D;.&#xA0;</span></p>
<p><a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/south-africa.html">South Africa</a>&#x2018;s ruling ANC party said Trump&#x2019;s comments were &#x201C;extremely offensive&#x201D;, with a spokeswoman saying the party would never deign to make such derogatory remarks.</p>
<p>Morocco-based Africa analyst Adama Gaye told Al Jazeera: &#x201C;Trump has shown a continuous display of racism towards Africa [and people from poor nations].&#x201D;</p>
<p>Abdulsalam Kayode, a resident of the <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/nigeria.html">Nigeria</a>&#x2018;s&#xA0;capital Lagos, told Al Jazeera that the US president&#x2019;s comments are &#x201C;not unexpected from somebody of this nature [because] we already know this kind of person&#x201D;.&#xA0;</p>
<p>Commenting on the invitation to Norwegians, Washington DC-based political analyst Bill Schneider told Al Jazeera: &#x201C;That&#x2019;s the racist element. Norwegians are white, they&#x2019;re northern Europeans. He was referring earlier, in his vulgar comment, to [people of] African descent.&#xA0;</p>
<p>&#x201C;These are racist comments. He has said things like this before when he talked about Nigerians who won&#x2019;t go back to live in huts and he talked about Haitians who bring AIDS to the United States. These are all confirmations of what a lot of people have long suspected &#x2013; that he harbours racism.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Many took to social media to condemn the president, including members of his own Republican party.</p>
<p>Republican politician Mia Love, who is of Haitian descent, said: &#x201C;The president&#x2019;s comments are unkind, divisive, elitist and fly in the face of our nation&#x2019;s values.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Democratic State Senator Linda Dorcena Forry said on Twitter: &#x201C;<span>I have to first express how demoralising &amp; upsetting it is to have to register my outrage again and again over hateful remarks made by my own president.&#x201D; </span></p>
<p><span>She then posted a statement saying: &#x201C;I&#x2019;m very disappointed in us, the people of the United States, who saw fit to elect an ignorant, mean-spirited, white supremacist to the most powerful office in the world.&#x201D;</span></p>

<p>Writer Wajahat Ali said in a tweet: &#x201C;In just 11 days, Trump has insulted Pakistan, a country of 200 million, Haiti (11 million), El Salvador (6 million), the entire continent of Africa (which is not a country &amp; has 1.2 billion) &amp; millions of Americans.
