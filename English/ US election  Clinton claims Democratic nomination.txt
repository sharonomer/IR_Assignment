<p>Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton has laid claim to the party&#x2019;s presidential nomination after a series of victories in primaries.</p>
<p>Clinton won resoundingly with 56 percent of votes in California, the largest state in the US and a key target of her opponent, Bernie Sanders.&#xA0;</p>
<p>Clinton also took the states of New Mexico, South Dakota, and New Jersey on Tuesday evening&#xA0;before declaring victory over Sanders for the Democratic Party nomination. Sanders won North Dakota and Montana states.</p>
<p>Serving US President Barack Obama called Clinton to congratulate her on securing enough delegates to clinch the nomination.</p>

<p>&#x201C;Thanks to you, we&#x2019;ve reached a milestone,&#x201D; she said at a rally in New York, before taking aim at her likely Republican competitor, Donald Trump.</p>
<p>Clinton told supporters in New York that Trump was &#x201C;temperamentally unfit&#x201D; to be president, citing Trump&#x2019;s attacks on a federal judge, reporters and women.</p>
<p>&#x201C;He wants to win by stoking fear and rubbing salt in wounds and reminding us daily just how great he is,&#x201D; Clinton said.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Well, we believe we should lift each other up, not tear each other down.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Sanders has vowed to continue his campaign to next week&#x2019;s primary in Washington DC and further to the convention held in Philadelphia on July 25.</p>
<p>&#x201C;The fight in front of us is a very, very steep fight but we will continue to fight for every vote and every delegate,&#x201D; he told a rally in Santa Monica, California.</p>

<p>Clinton declaration of victory comes a day after the Associated Press announced she was the presumptive Democratic nominee based on a count of elected pledged delegates and unelected superdelegates.</p>
<p>The Sanders campaign rejected that announcement as premature and said it would continue to campaign in California.</p>
<p>In an interview with NBC News, Sanders expressed concern that the news of Clinton&#x2019;s victory came the night before &#x201C;the largest primary&#x201D; and that it was based on what he described as &#x201C;anonymous&#x201D; commitments from superdelegates, who vote at the Democratic convention in late July.</p>
<p>&#x201C;They got on the phone, as I understand it, and started hounding superdelegates to tell them in an anonymous way who they were voting for,&#x201D;&#xA0;he said.</p>
<p>&#x201C;The night before the largest primary, biggest primary in the whole process, they make this announcement.</p>
<p>&#x201C;So I was really disappointed in what The AP did.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Sanders is set to meet Obama at the White House on Thursday, the Reuters news agency reported.</p>
