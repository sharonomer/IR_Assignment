<p class="p1">Egypt&#x2019;s former President Hosni Mubarak has <a href="/news/middleeast/2014/12/obituary-hosni-mubarak-egypt-longest-serving-president-20141216115419523108.html">died</a> at the age of 91, state television said on Tuesday, weeks after undergoing surgery.</p>
<p class="p1">Mubarak ruled Egypt for nearly 30 years until he stepped down amid mass protests against his rule in 2011, although he and his family stayed in the country.</p>
<p class="p1">He was sentenced to life in prison for conspiring to murder 239 demonstrators during the 18-day revolt but was freed in 2017 after being cleared of the charges.</p>
<p class="p1">He was, however, convicted in 2015, along with his two sons, of diverting public funds and using the money to upgrade family properties. They were sentenced to three years in jail.</p>
