<p>Former President Barack Obama blasted President Donald Trump&#x2019;s handling of the <a href="/news/2020/10/6/trump-says-us-learning-to-live-with-covid-19-us-election-ne">coronavirus pandemic</a>, his response to racial unrest and his fundamental unfitness for the job in his first in-person campaign pitch Wednesday for Joe Biden, his former vice president.</p>
<p>With less than two weeks until Election Day, Obama delivered a sweeping condemnation of Trump while urging Black men, progressives and other voters not to sit out the November 3 election.</p>
<p>&#x201C;This election requires every single one of us to do our part. What we do these next 13 days will matter for decades to come,&#x201D; Obama said at a drive-in rally of about 300 cars. He later warned, &#x201C;The fact that we don&#x2019;t get 100 percent of what we want right away is not a good reason not to vote.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Obama&#x2019;s visit to Philadelphia underscores the significance of Pennsylvania, the swing state that Biden himself has visited the most this campaign season. Trump has prioritised the state as well, and his aides acknowledge that his path to victory would narrow considerably without the state&#x2019;s 20 electoral votes. The president on Wednesday was in Erie, one of a handful of Pennsylvania counties that Obama won twice before it flipped to Trump.</p>
<p>Specifically targeting voters who might be disillusioned, Obama offered a defence of the nation&#x2019;s decency and personal validation that Biden and his running mate, California Senator Kamala Harris, can live up to it.</p>
<p>&#x201C;America is a good and decent place, but we&#x2019;ve just seen so much nonsense and noise that sometimes it&#x2019;s hard to remember,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;I&#x2019;m asking you to remember what this country can be &#x2026; I&#x2019;m asking you to believe in Joe&#x2019;s ability and Kamala&#x2019;s ability to lead this country out of these dark times and help us build it back better.&#x201D;</p>

<p>During his speech and at an earlier roundtable with Black men, Biden talked up the Democrats&#x2019; plans to confront the coronavirus while dealing with the country&#x2019;s social and economic tensions, including disparities deeply rooted in racism.</p>
<p>&#x201C;I am so confident in Joe Biden and Kamala Harris surrounding themselves with people who are serious, who know what they&#x2019;re doing, who are representative of all people &#x2014; not just some people &#x2014; and us being able to then dig ourselves out of this hole,&#x201D; Obama said.</p>
<h2>Boosting enthusiasm</h2>
<p>Four years ago, Obama delivered Hillary Clinton&#x2019;s closing argument in Philadelphia &#x2014; at a rally for thousands the night before Election Day on Independence Mall. Now, with the coronavirus pandemic upending campaigning, far fewer voters saw the former president in person. But he used the spotlight he had to remind voters of 2016, when Trump upset Clinton narrowly in Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin to forge an Electoral College majority despite losing the popular vote nationally.</p>
<p>&#x201C;We can&#x2019;t be complacent,&#x201D; Obama warned. &#x201C;I don&#x2019;t care about the polls. There were a whole bunch of polls last time. Didn&#x2019;t work out because a whole bunch of folks stayed at home and got lazy and complacent. Not this time. Not this election.&#x201D;</p>
<p>The roundtable was a personalised version of the same message, with the nation&#x2019;s first Black president urging Black men especially not to give in to apathy. The host city, Philadelphia, is among the Democratic bastions in key battleground states where Black turnout four years ago fell off from Obama&#x2019;s 2012 re-election in large enough numbers to tip the election in Trump&#x2019;s favour.</p>

But he said not voting gives away power.<p></p>
<p>&#x201C;The answer for young people when I talk to them is not that voting makes everything perfect,&#x201D; Obama said. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s that it makes things better&#x201D; because politicians respond to and reflect the citizens who cast votes.</p>
<p>&#x201C;One of the biggest tricks that&#x2019;s perpetrated on the American people is this idea that the government is separate from you,&#x201D; Obama said. &#x201C;The government&#x2019;s us. Of, by and for the people. It wasn&#x2019;t always for all of us, but the way it&#x2019;s designed, it works based on who&#x2019;s at the table.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Despite the smaller scale, Democrats said that, as one of the men who knows Biden best &#x2013; both as his former partner in the White House and personally, Obama remains one of the party&#x2019;s greatest assets in the final stretch of the campaign.</p>
<p>Obama has already been helpful to the Biden campaign, adapting to the shift to virtual events by focusing much of his work on getting younger Americans to vote. He has appeared on Twitch, the video game streaming platform, pushed a voter registration message on Snapchat and recorded a video for the Shade Room, a Black-owned Instagram page and media company with 21 million followers.</p>

<p>Obama has appeared on two podcasts run by some of his former aides and has lent his name to texts and emails encouraging supporters to register to vote and donate money to the campaign. Obama has also been a big money draw for the campaign &#x2014; he appeared at two virtual fundraisers with Harris this month and a handful prior to that. A grassroots virtual fundraiser Obama headlined with Biden in June brought in $7.6m.</p>
<p>Obama has also been active for down-ballot Democrats, raising money for House Democrats and appearing in ads for some of the party&#x2019;s top candidates, like Sara Gideon, running for the Senate in Maine, and for vulnerable incumbents, like Michigan Senator Gary Peters. And he filmed a series of digital videos for the Democratic National Committee emphasising the need for voters to make plans for casting their ballot.</p>
