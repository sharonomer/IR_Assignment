<p>The Egyptian army has overthrown President <a class="internallink" href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2013/07/20137314127329966.html" target="_blank">Mohamed Morsi</a>, announcing a roadmap for the country&#x2019;s political future that will be implemented by a national reconciliation committee.</p>
<p>According to a senior member of the Muslim Brotherhood, Morsi is being held in a military facility with top aides.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Morsi and the entire presidential team are under house arrest in the Presidential Republican Guards Club,&#x201D; Gehad El-Haddad, the son of a top Morsi aide, told AFP news agency&#xA0;on Thursday. Haddad&#x2019;s father, Essam El-Haddad, widely seen as Morsi&#x2019;s right-hand man, was among those held, he added.</p>
<p>The head of Egypt&#x2019;s armed forces issued a declaration on Wednesday evening suspending the constitution and appointing the head of the Supreme Constitutional Court, Adly Mansour,&#xA0;as interim head of state.</p>
<p>Mansour would be sworn in on Thursday.</p>
<p>Morsi&#x2019;s presidential Facebook page quoted him as saying he rejected the army statement as a military coup.</p>
<p>The ousted leader was believed to be at a Republican Guard barracks in Cairo but it was not clear whether he was under arrest.</p>
<p>In a televised broadcast, flanked by military leaders, religious authorities and political figures, <a class="internallink" href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2013/07/201373112752442652.html" target="_blank">General Abdel&#xA0;Fattah al-Sisi</a> effectively declared the removal of &#xA0;Morsi.</p>
<p><strong>Early elections</strong></p>
<p>Sisi called for presidential and parliamentary elections, a panel to review the constitution and a national reconciliation committee that would include youth movements. He said the roadmap had been agreed by a range of political groups.</p>
<p>Islamist supporters of Morsi who have gathered in a Cairo suburb reacted angrily to the announcement by the army.</p>
<p>Some broke up paving stones, forming piles of rocks. Muslim Brotherhood security guards in hard hats and holding sticks formed a cordon around the encampment, close to a mosque.&#xA0;Men and women wept and chanted.</p>
<p>Denouncing military chief Sisi, some shouted: &#x201C;Sisi is void! Islam is coming! We will not leave!&#x201D;</p>
<p><strong>Violent clashes</strong></p>
<p>At least 14 people were killed when opponents and supporters of Morsi clashed after the army announced his removal, &#xA0;officials said. Eight of those died in the northern city of Marsa Matrouh, including two members of the security fources.</p>
<p>Three people were killed and at least 50 wounded in Alexandria, state news agency MENA reported; a woman stabbed in the stomach, and two men killed by birdshot.</p>
<p>Three people were also killed and 14 wounded in the southern city of Minya, including two police, MENA said.</p>
<p>Dozens more were wounded in Fayoum, south of Cairo, where unidentified assailants looted the local offices of the Freedom and Justice Party, the Brotherhood&#x2019;s political wing, MENA said.</p>
<p>In Cairo&#x2019;s Tahrir Square, the security forces looked on as tens of thousands of anti-Morsi protesters rallied in a demonstration that dwarfed that of Morsi supporters in Nasr City, on the opposite side of town.</p>
<p><strong>&#x2018;Revolution re-launched&#x2019;</strong></p>
<p>Speaking shortly after Sisi&#x2019;s announcement, liberal opposition leader <a class="internallink" href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2013/07/20137311506961487.html" target="_blank">Mohamed ElBaradei</a> said the &#x201C;2011 revolution was re-launched&#x201D; and that the roadmap meets the demand of the protesters.</p>
<p>Egypt&#x2019;s leading Muslim and Christian clerics also backed the army-sponsored roadmap.</p>

<p>Pope Tawadros, the head of the Coptic Church, said the plan offered a political vision and would ensure security for all Egyptians, about 10 percent of whom are Christian. Egypt&#x2019;s second largest Islamist group, the Nour party, said in a statement that it agreed to the army roadmap in order to avoid further conflict.</p>
<p>Morsi, Egypt&#x2019;s first freely elected president, came under huge pressure in the run-up to Sunday&#x2019;s anniversary of his maiden year in office, with his opponents accusing him of failing the 2011 revolution by concentrating power in Islamist hands.</p>
<p>The embattled 62-year-old proposed a &#x201C;consensus government&#x201D; as a way out of the crisis. That was not enough for the army, and Mansour, a previously little known judge, was installed as the country&#x2019;s interim leader.</p>
