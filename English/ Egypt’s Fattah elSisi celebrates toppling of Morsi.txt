<p>Egypt&#x2019;s President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi has celebrated the 2013 overthrow of the country&#x2019;s first democratically-elected president by ordering a lavish military display in the capital and celebrations across the country.</p>
<p>Military jets roared over Cairo early on Thursday as Sisi addressed the nation in a pre-recorded address while his supporters were instructed to gather in the streets later in the evening after the breaking of the Ramadan fast.</p>
<p>&#x201C;On this glorious day, I would like to assure you that we are working hard to realise the hopes of the Egyptian people for the better future they deserve,&#x201D; Sisi said in an early-morning televised speech.</p>
<p>The official holiday, which the government refers to as the &#x201C;June 30 Revolution&#x201D; was also marked with musical performances and free entry to museums.</p>
<p>&#x201C;The June 30 Revolution reasserts the impossibility of imposing a status quo on the Egyptian people. Anyone who imagines that he can successfully do that is deluding himself,&#x201D; Sisi said, alluding to Mohamed Morsi&#x2019;s Muslim Brotherhood supporters.</p>

<p>Morsi was toppled by the military in July 2013 following days of street protests by Egyptians demanding that he be removed.</p>

<p>Sisi was the military chief at the time who led the takeover and ran for president two years later, winning the vote in a landslide.</p>
<p>Sisi has since launched a persistent and extensive crackdown and has declared&#xA0;the Muslim Brotherhood a &#x201C;terrorist organisation&#x201D;.</p>
<p>Thousands of Brotherhood members have been sentenced to death or life imprisonment, while others are standing trial or being held without formal charges.</p>
<p>Sisi spoke of &#x201C;terrorism&#x201D; in his speech and warned against anyone attempting to break Egyptians and their &#x201C;hopes and dreams&#x201D;.</p>
<p>Security was stepped up across the country &#x2013; where protests are effectively banned &#x2013; but the day was punctured by violence in the Sinai Peninsula where a Christian priest was shot dead and two members of the country&#x2019;s security forces were killed in separate attacks.</p>

<p>Also on Thursday, six members of Egypt&#x2019;s security forces were killed in clashes with smugglers on the country&#x2019;s western border.</p>
<p>The smugglers were trying to infiltrate Egypt from Libya, the military said in a statement, adding that several smugglers were killed.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, Sisi had appealed to security forces and agencies to stop anyone from &#x201C;spoiling&#x201D; the occasion.</p>
<p>In recent months, a growing number of Egyptians have begun losing patience with Sisi over corruption, poverty, and unemployment, the same issues that led to Mubarak&#x2019;s downfall, while Sisi has appeared increasingly defiant in his speeches.</p>
<p>In April, thousands of people marched Cairo in the biggest anti-government demonstrations since Sisi took office in 2014, shouting slogans such as &#x201C;Down with the regime&#x201D; and &#x201C;Leave&#x201D;, both of which were used during the 2011 revolution that toppled former president Hosni Mubarak.</p>
