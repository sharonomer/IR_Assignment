<p>The Egyptian government has demanded that CBS should not air an interview with President <a href="/news/middleeast/2013/07/201373112752442652.html">Abdel Fattah el-Sisi</a>&#xA0;that he gave to the US network&#x2019;s&#xA0;<span>investigative news programme, &#x201C;60 Minutes&#x201D;.</span></p>
<p>CBS <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/egypt-president-abdel-fattah-el-sisi-denies-holding-political-prisoners/" target="_blank">said</a>&#xA0;the information given by Sisi in the interview, such as denying the detention of political prisoners and admitting to closely cooperating with Israel, was &#x201C;not the kind of news his government wanted broadcast&#x201D;.</p>
<p>&#x201C;The 60 Minutes team was contacted by the Egyptian ambassador shortly after and told the interview could not be aired,&#x201D; the network said.</p>

<p>However, CBS said the segment, which they dubbed &#x201C;The interview Egypt&#x2019;s government doesn&#x2019;t want on TV&#x201D;&#xA0; will be aired on Sunday at 7pm Eastern Time (00:00 GMT).</p>
<p>Interviewed by Scott Pelley, Sisi denied having political prisoners and &#x201C;prisoners of opinion&#x201D; in prison.</p>
<p>&#x201C;There are no political prisoners in <a href="/topics/country/egypt.html">Egypt</a>,&#x201D; he said, his face shiny with sweat.</p>
<p>&#x201C;We are trying to stand against extremists who impose their ideology on the people,&#x201D; he continued. &#x201C;Now they are subject to a fair trial, and it may take years but we have to follow the law.&#x201D;</p>
<h2>On political prisoners in Egypt</h2>
<p>Sisi dismissed reports from international rights organisations such as Human Rights Watch that estimated Egypt has imprisoned as many as 60,000 political activists.</p>
<p>&#x201C;I don&#x2019;t know where they [HRW] got that figure,&#x201D; he said.</p>
<p>The rights group had <a href="https://www.hrw.org/report/2016/09/28/we-are-tombs/abuses-egypts-scorpion-prison#" target="_blank">interviewed</a> a former prisoner, relatives of detainees, and lawyers who had documented abusive conditions held in prisons, such as overcrowding, torture, sexual assault, and deaths in custody.</p>
<p>The most notorious of these prisons is the Tora maximum security jail, popularly known as &#x201C;the Scorpion&#x201D;.</p>
<p>The Egyptian president also admitted that his army has been closely collaborating with Israel in the Sinai Peninsula against armed fighters.</p>
<p>&#x201C;That is correct,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;We have a wide range of cooperation with the Israelis.&#x201D;</p>
<p>In recent years, various rights groups have highlighted Egypt&#x2019;s increasingly repressive policies against its own citizens, particularly its crackdown on freedom of expression.</p>

<p>&#x201C;The security services have been ruthless in clamping down on any remaining political, social or even cultural independent spaces,&#x201D; Amnesty International&#x2019;s North Africa Campaigns Director Najia Bounaim <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2018/09/egypt-unprecedented-crackdown-on-freedom-of-expression-under-alsisi-turns-egypt-into-openair-prison/" target="_blank">said last year.</a></p>
<p>&#x201C;These measures, more extreme than anything seen in former President <a href="/topics/people/hosni-mubarak.html">Hosni Mubarak</a>&#x2018;s repressive 30-year rule, have turned Egypt into an open-air prison for critics.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Sisi came to power on the back of a <a href="/news/2018/07/egypt-coup-years-sisi-power-180703123648976.html">popularly-backed military coup</a> in 2013 that deposed former President <a href="/topics/people/mohamed-morsi.html">Mohamed Morsi</a>, Egypt&#x2019;s first democratically elected leader.</p>
