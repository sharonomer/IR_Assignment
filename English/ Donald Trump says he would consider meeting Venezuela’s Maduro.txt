<p><span>US President Donald Trump says he would consider meeting Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and indicated he is not entirely confident in the country&#x2019;s opposition leader.</span></p>
<p><span>A power struggle has been raging in Venezuela since Juan Guaido declared himself acting president in January 2019 in a bid to overthrow Maduro, who started a second term following elections boycotted by the opposition and internationally dismissed as fraudulent.</span></p>
<p>Nearly 60 countries &#x2013; including the United States &#x2013; recognised Guaido, but China and Russia backed Maduro &#x2013; whose regime has been hit by punishing sanctions from Washington.</p>
<p><span>But despite tensions, Trump told news site Axios he would be open to a meeting.</span></p>
<p><span>&#x201C;I would maybe think about that &#x2026; Maduro would like to meet. And I&#x2019;m never opposed to meetings &#x2013; you know, rarely opposed to meetings,&#x201D; the president said.</span></p>
<p><span>&#x201C;I always say, you lose very little with meetings. But at this moment, I&#x2019;ve turned them down.&#x201D;</span></p>
<h2><strong>No confidence</strong></h2>
<p><span>Ties between Washington and Maduro&#x2019;s socialist government frayed even further in May when Venezuela detained 52 alleged mercenaries, including two retired members of the US military, accusing them of orchestrating a maritime &#x201C;invasion&#x201D; with American support.</span></p>
<p><span>Washington denied any involvement.</span></p>

<p><span>But despite his government&#x2019;s consistent backing of the opposition leader, Axios reported during the interview Trump &#x201C;indicated he doesn&#x2019;t have much confidence in Guaido&#x201D;.</span></p>
<p><span>The president said he was &#x201C;firmly against what&#x2019;s going on in Venezuela,&#x201D; but &#x2013; referring to the recognition of Guaido &#x2013; added: &#x201C;I was okay with it &#x2026; I don&#x2019;t think it was very meaningful one way or the other.&#x201D;</span></p>
<p><span>The interview came as the White House was handling the fallout from explosive claims in a book by Trump&#x2019;s former national security adviser John Bolton, who was a key player on many diplomatic fronts.</span></p>
<p><span>According to excerpts published by Axios, Bolton wrote that Trump &#x201C;thought Guaido was &#x2018;weak&#x2019; as opposed to Maduro, who was &#x2018;strong&#x2019;.&#x201D;</span></p>
<p><span>The president also called Guaido &#x201C;the Beto O&#x2019;Rourke of Venezuela&#x201D;, according to the Bolton excerpt, referring to the Democratic presidential candidate who dropped out early in the 2020 US presidential race and was repeatedly mocked by Trump.</span></p>
<p><span>Trump slammed Bolton as a &#x201C;nut job&#x201D; who may be the &#x201C;dumbest human being on Earth&#x201D; over his backing of the US-led Iraq war in 2003.</span></p>
