<p>Barack Obama, the US president, has won Florida&#x2019;s 29 electoral votes in the 2012 US presidential election.</p>
<p>Saturday&#x2019;s announcement comes four days after the then incumbent was declared the winner of presidential polls in the election last Tuesday after having secured 303 electoral votes.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Florida has spoken loudly in support of moving our nation forward,&#x201D; Ashley Walker, the Obama campaign&#x2019;s director for Florida, said in a news release making reference to the incumbent&#x2019;s campaign slogan.</p>
<p>She added that the win was a testament to the campaign&#x2019;s <a class="InternalLink" href="http://www.aljazeera.com/video/americas/2012/11/201211416435099929.html">volunteers and staff</a>.</p>
<p>The Florida Secretary of State&#x2019;s Office said that with almost 100 per cent of the vote counted, Obama led Mitt Romney, his Republican challenger, 50 per cent to 49.1 per cent, a difference of about 74,000 votes.</p>
<p>That was over the half-per cent margin where a computer recount would have been automatically ordered unless Romney had waived it.</p>
<p>Florida was the last of the nation&#x2019;s 50 states to declare official results for the election of the country&#x2019;s forty-fifth president.</p>
<p>The deadline for Tallahassee, the state&#x2019;s capital, to report vote totals in the state&#x2019;s 67 counties was noon (1700GMT) on Saturday.</p>
<p>Exit polls conducted for The Associated Press news agency showed Obama was favoured by more than 9 of 10 black voters and 3 of 5 Latino voters in Florida. The president also was the choice of two-thirds of voters under age 30.</p>
<p>Romney, who was left with 206 electoral votes in the fiinal tally, led among both white and older voters.</p>
