<p class="BodyA"><span>The United States stands on the brink of history with the nomination of its first female presidential candidate, Hillary Clinton.&#xA0;</span>Paradoxically, electing a woman president for the US will not advance women&#x2019;s rights around the globe.</p>
<p class="BodyA"><span>This is because Clinton will immediately feel the need to demonstrate her power in a world that operates by traditionally male-dominated statecraft.</span></p>
<p class="BodyA"><span>That world will not allow her to redefine the US&#x2019; national interests, and consequently its foreign policy, in a way that will truly empower the world&#x2019;s women, particularly in Muslim countries where safety and security is needed the most.</span></p>

<h2 class="BodyA"><strong><span>Clinton and sexism</span></strong></h2>
<p class="BodyA"><span>This year Clinton hopes to capitalise on the women&#x2019;s vote by making equal pay, affordable childcare, fighting violence against women, women&#x2019;s reproductive rights all a </span><span class="Hyperlink0"><span><a href="https://www.hillaryclinton.com/issues/womens-rights-and-opportunity/" target="_blank"><span>major part of her platform</span></a></span></span><span>.</span></p>
<p class="BodyA"><span>Yet, US politics is still a long way from gender parity. Clinton is the first woman to make it this high in a power structure which until 1920 did not allow women to vote.</span></p>
<p class="BodyA"><span>As a former senator, Clinton is one of 46 women who have been elected to the Senate since 1922.</span></p>
<p class="BodyA"><span>Only 20 women senators are serving in this Congress year out of a house consisting of 100 members, meaning that the Senate does not have 50 percent representation of women members.</span></p>
<p class="BodyA"><span>In the House of Representatives, the number of women is at almost exactly the same percentage: 20 percent out of 435 elected members are women.</span></p>
<p class="BodyA"><span>In her pursuit of the presidency, Clinton </span><span class="Hyperlink0"><span><a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/katie-massa-kennedy/hillary-clinton-and-the-b_b_9890868.html" target="_blank"><span>faces sexist attacks</span></a></span></span><span> which hinge on an <span class="Hyperlink1"><span><a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/katie-massa-kennedy/hillary-clinton-and-the-b_b_9890868.html" target="_blank">historical mistrust of women in power</a>&#xA0;</span></span></span><span class="None">in the US.</span></p>

			<p>Clinton has the chance to make history, but as the US&apos; first woman president, will she continue to serve a male-dominated establishment, or will she choose to redefine national interests in a way that promotes women&apos;s rights and the security of women and girls around the world?</p>

<p class="BodyA"><span class="None">While the country is arguably the most powerful nation on earth, that power rests on a supremely male vision of power: military strength, &#x201C;hawkish strategies&#x201D;, &#x201C;muscular diplomacy&#x201D; and the ability to apply hard and soft power to create what Joseph S Nye calls &#x201C;smart power&#x201D;.</span></p>
<p class="BodyA"><span class="None">The military, the arm of the US government which functions as an extension of its foreign policy, continues to be a male bastion, both in numbers (85 percent male) and </span><span class="Hyperlink1">in culture and psychology</span><span class="None">, as cases of sexual harassment in the military continue to prove&#xA0;(</span><span class="Hyperlink0"><span><a href="https://www.apa.org/about/gr/issues/military/military-culture.pdf" target="_blank"><span>PDF</span></a></span></span><span class="None">).</span></p>
<h2 class="BodyA"><span class="None"><strong>&#x2018;Hegemonic masculinity&#x2019;</strong></span></h2>
<p class="BodyA"><span class="None">This gender gap in the US politics extends to other countries &#x2013; women leaders around the world have struggled with these dilemmas in different ways.</span></p>
<p class="BodyA"><span class="None">In South Asian countries, women heads of state are judged &#x2013; partially accurately &#x2013; as ineffective figureheads. Benazir Bhutto of Pakistan, Khaleda Zia and Sheikh Hasina of Bangladesh, Sri Lanka&#x2019;s Sirimavo Bandaranaike were the female continuation of male-dominated politics, with all its corruption and in-fights.</span></p>
<p class="BodyA"><span class="None">Women leaders are seen as strong and effective &#x2013; Israel&#x2019;s Golda Meir, Britain&#x2019;s Margaret Thatcher and India&#x2019;s Indira Gandhi &#x2013; only when they enact unforgiving domestic policy, tough foreign policy and go to war as ruthlessly as men do.</span></p>

<p>This runs contrary to the commonly held belief among feminist circles that more women leadership would result in the reduction of global conflict and violence, as well as a concentration on social democracy and the uplift of poor and marginalised women.</p>
<p class="BodyA"><span class="None">In reality, the world&#x2019;s power structures continue to operate under RW Connell&#x2019;s concept of &#x201C;</span><span class="Hyperlink0"><span><a href="http://gas.sagepub.com/content/19/6/829.abstract" target="_blank"><span>hegemonic masculinity</span></a></span></span><span class="None">&#x201C;, so women find it hard to ascend the male hierarchy in international relations unless they are willing to espouse the militarism that it favours.</span></p>
<p class="BodyA"><span class="None">A woman leader favouring peacemaking and diplomacy over war and conflict could be labelled as weak because of her gender, rather than using a legitimate part of her leadership capabilities, policies and choices.</span></p>
<h2 class="BodyA"><span class="None"><strong>A feminist foreign policy?</strong></span></h2>
<p class="BodyA"><span class="None">If there are hopes that Clinton will enact a solely </span><span class="Hyperlink2"><span><span><a href="http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/swedens-feminist-foreign-minister" target="_blank">feminist foreign policy</a>,</span></span></span><span class="None"> the way Swedish Foreign Minister Margot Wallstrom tried in 2015, they can also be abandoned now.</span></p>
<p class="BodyA"><span class="None">Foreign policy is enacted through institutions, not individuals, and they operate on the doctrine of necessities, not on principles &#x2013; something that Wallstrom forgot, in championing gender rights abroad and attempting to bring Saudi Arabia to task over its human rights record.</span></p>

<p class="BodyA"><span class="None">She tried to make the principle of gender equality a top priority in an arena that neatly ignores the safety and security of women when it comes to war, arms deals, peace-making and defence treaties.</span></p>
<p class="BodyA"><span class="None">For all Sweden&#x2019;s progressiveness, its own male-dominated military-industrial complex, hungry for foreign money from arms sales, rejected her feminist overtures in foreign policy in the end.</span></p>

<p>Her pro-Israel stance worries Muslims in the Middle East and other Muslim countries. Her pro-Saudi stance has had the same effect.</p>
<p class="BodyA"><span class="None">Clinton may be progressive at home, but abroad, she is regarded as pro-establishment, pro-Wall Street and pro-military-industrial-complex.</span></p>

<h2 class="BodyA"><span class="None"><strong>Will she conform?</strong></span></h2>
<p class="BodyA"><span class="None">US foreign policy flirts with feminism, but only when the it wants to soften up Muslim countries, and to advance women&#x2019;s rights as part of the export of democracy.</span></p>
<p class="BodyA"><span class="None">Women ambassadors are sent to those Muslim countries, and so are programmes to promote women as entrepreneurs or girls&#x2019; education abound.</span></p>
<p class="BodyA"><span class="None">But when the US national interests of economy necessitate dealing with a regressive countries, or war and invasion of Muslim countries such as Iraq, Syria, Afghanistan or Libya, those ideals are thrown out the window.</span></p>

<p class="BodyA"><span class="None">For all Clinton&#x2019;s talk about gender equality, the US&#x2019; wars have devastated the lives of countless Muslim women.</span></p>

<p class="BodyA"><span class="None">It&#x2019;s hard to see Clinton giving up the opportunity to secure her presidency with a hawkishness that puts her up in the echelons of power with the big boys.</span></p>
<p class="BodyA"><span class="None">For her, conforming to the US&#x2019; traditionalist, androcentric vision of global might may be the key to her political survival &#x2013; and the continued suffering of women in conflict areas around the world.</span></p>
