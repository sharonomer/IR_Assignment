<p>It will not be easy for Hosni Mubarak, the Egyptian president, to persuade the military elite&#xA0;to accept his son Gamal as his successor, according to leaked US embassy memos.</p>
<p>But&#xA0;Gamal&#xA0;is among the most likely contenders to the top job along with Omar Suleiman, the spy chief, and &#x201C;dark horse&#x201D; Amr Moussa, the Arab League secretary-general,&#xA0;according to the <a class="InternalLink" href="http://www.wikileaks.ch/cable/2007/05/07CAIRO1417.html">cables released by WikiLeaks</a> on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&#x201C;It is hard to argue that Gamal is not being groomed for the presidency,&#x201D; then US ambassador Francis Ricciardone wrote in a May 2007 secret cable, noting his &#x201C;increasingly robust role&#x201D; in the ruling National Democratic Party.</p>
<p>A presidential election will be held next year, and the&#xA0;ailing Mubarak has still not announced whether he will&#xA0;run again.</p>
<p>Citing&#xA0;strict&#xA0;legal requirements for candidacy and weak opposition leadership, Ricciardone wrote that there were few other Egyptian personalities other than Gamal &#x201C;with the national stature and political capital to seriously contend for the presidency.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Due to the paranoia of the Egyptian dictatorship, the cable said, no other name can safely or respectfully be&#xA0;raised as a contender.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Many in the Egyptian elite see his succession as positive, as his likely continuation of the current status quo would serve their business and political interests.&#x201D;</p>
<p><strong>&#x2018;Stumbling block&#x2019;</strong></p>
<p>But the memo suggests the military elite may have&#xA0;different preferences.</p>
<p>&#x201C;A key stumbling block for a Gamal candidacy could be the military,&#x201D; Ricciardone wrote, noting that the four Egyptian presidents since the 1952 coup that overthrew the monarchy came from military ranks, including Hosni Mubarak.</p>
<p>The cables conclude that, if before his death or if he steps aside, &#xA0;the president&#xA0;might be able to install&#xA0;Gamal,&#xA0;a&#xA0;47-year-old banker-turned-politician.</p>
<p>If the elder Mubarak dies in office, however, the succession scenario becomes &#x201C;messier,&#x201D; with no guarantee of military support for Gamal but also few other clear alternatives, according to the cable.</p>
<p>&#x201C;The military has historically been the ultimate guarantor of the president&#x2019;s rule,&#x201D; the document said.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Gamal did not serve as a military officer, and we believe he did not complete his compulsory service.</p>
<p>&#x201C;His power base is his father, and so while he could conceivably be installed prior to Mubarak&#x2019;s death, the task would become far more difficult &#x2026; once the pharaoh has departed the scene,&#x201D;&#xA0;it added.</p>
<p>Mubarak never appointed a vice-president, further complicating the question of who will succeed him.</p>
<p>The cable says Suleiman, who has headed Egypt&#x2019;s intelligence service since the early 1990s, was often cited as likely to be named vice-president and was &#x201C;deeply personally hurt&#x201D;&#xA0;when Mubarak reneged, according to an alleged personal friend of the spy chief.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Many of our contacts believe that Suleiman, because of his military background, would at the least have to figure in in any succession scenario for Gamal, possibly as a transitional figure,&#x201D; the memo said.</p>
