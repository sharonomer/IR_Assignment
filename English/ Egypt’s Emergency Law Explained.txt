<p class="story-body__introduction">Lifting the state of emergency, initially imposed following late President Anwar Sadat&#x2019;s assassination in 1981 and lasted for three decades under his successor <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/topics/people/hosni-mubarak.html">Hosni Mubarak</a>,&#xA0;has been one of the key demands of the <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2017/01/tragedy-egypt-stolen-revolution-170125062306232.html">January 2011 popular uprising</a>.</p>
<p class="story-body__introduction">In June 2012,&#xA0;<a class="InternalLink" href="http://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/egypt.html" target="_blank">Egypt</a>&#x2018;s state of emergency finally came to an end.&#xA0;</p>
<p class="story-body__introduction">However, in January 2013, emergency law was reintroduced by elected President <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/06/profile-egypt-deposed-president-mohamed-morsi-160607074148919.html">Mohamed Morsi</a> for 30 days, to curb renewed unrest. In August of the same year, and following a military coup led by then defence minister Sisi against Morsi, Egypt&#x2019;s military-backed government then declared a one-month state of emergency following the violent dispersal of <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/topics/organisations/muslim-brotherhood.html">Muslim Brotherhood</a> supporters in what came to be known as <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/programmes/aljazeeraworld/2016/08/massacre-rabaa-160816085846897.html">Rabaa al-Adawiya massacre</a> in which hundreds of civilians were killed at hands of police and security forces.</p>

<h4 class="story-body__introduction"><span style="font-size:1.5em">What does Egypt&#x2019;s constitution say about emergency laws?</span></h4>
<p class="story-body__introduction">This is the first time since&#xA0;the adoption of <a class="InternalLink" href="http://www.wipo.int/edocs/lexdocs/laws/en/eg/eg060en.pdf" target="_blank">the 2014 constitution</a> that a nationwide state of emergency is declared. The constitution imposes limits on the president&#x2019;s powers to declare an indefinite state of emergency.</p>
<p>Article 154 states that the president must consult the Cabinet before issuing an official declaration, after which the decision must be submitted to Parliament. A parliamentary majority must approve the declaration within seven days of its issuance for the three-month state of emergency to go into effect.</p>
<p>Once this period elapses, it can only be extended for an additional three months by a two-thirds majority vote.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">If Parliament is not in session, the matter is taken to the Cabinet for approval, to be presented to the House of Representatives in its first session.</p>
<h2><strong>What are the powers granted to the president?</strong></h2>
<p>Despite this limitation, the emergency law still grants the president exceptional powers.</p>
<p>The emergency law grants the president, and those acting on his behalf, the power to refer civilians to State Security Emergency Courts for the duration of the three-month period. There is no appeal process for State Security Emergency Court verdicts.</p>
<p>It also extends powers of the president to monitoring and intercepting all forms of communication and correspondence, imposing censorship prior to publication and confiscating extant publications, impose a curfew for or order the closure of commercial establishments, sequestration of private properties, as well as designating areas for evacuation.</p>
<p>Article 4 of the emergency law grants the Armed Forces the authority to address any violations of these powers.</p>

<h2><strong>The situation today</strong></h2>
<p>The emergency measures allow security forces to detain people for any period of time, for virtually any reason. They also grant broad powers to restrict public gatherings and&#xA0;<a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/topics/subjects/press-freedoms.html">media freedom</a>.</p>
<p>But Egypt&#x2019;s human rights situation has already been the worst in decades.</p>
<p>Since Sisi took power in 2013,&#xA0;<a href="https://www.hrw.org/world-report/2017/country-chapters/egypt" target="_blank">human rights conditions</a>&#xA0;in the country continued to deteriorate.</p>
<p>Human rights organisations found that around&#xA0;<a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2017/01/tragedy-egypt-stolen-revolution-170125062306232.html">60,000</a>&#xA0;were imprisoned between 2013 and 2017.To accommodate them, the Egyptian authorities decided to build 10 additional prisons. The facilities that already house these prisoners are extremely overcrowded, according to Egypt&#x2019;s National Council for Human Rights.</p>
<p>A Human Rights Watch report on&#xA0;<a href="https://www.hrw.org/report/2016/09/27/we-are-tombs/abuses-egypts-scorpion-prison" target="_blank">Cairo&#x2019;s Scorpion Prison</a>&#xA0;found that the inmates were mostly political prisoners. The prisoners &#x201C;suffered abuses at the hands of Interior Ministry officers, including beatings, force feedings, deprivation of contact with relatives and lawyers, and interference in medical care&#x201D;.</p>
<p>There were 326 cases of extrajudicial killings in 2015, a number which rose to&#xA0;754 cases&#xA0;in the first half of 2016 alone, according to Al Nadeem Center, a local human rights group.</p>
<p>In August 2016, the Egyptian Coordination of Rights and Freedoms released a report on prison conditions in Egypt under Sisi, documenting 1,344&#xA0;incidents of torture &#x2013; including direct torture and intentional medical neglect &#x2013; in detention facilities and prisons between 2015 and 2016.</p>
<p>There are also reports of&#xA0;<a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/mde12/4368/2016/en/" target="_blank">forced disappearances</a>. Amnesty International recorded three to four disappearances a day between 2015 and 2016. Amnesty states that the number could be much higher since a lot of families fear the repercussions from reporting a disappearance case.</p>
<p class="ReadMoreContentSeparator"><a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2016/11/egypt-anti-protest-law-legalising-authoritarianism-161107095415334.html" target="_self"> READ MORE: Egypt&#x2019;s anti-protest law &#x2013; Legalising authoritarianism </a></p>
<p>Furthermore, Sisi issued a decree in 2014 that allowed the military wider jurisdiction, where civilians were&#xA0;<a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2014/11/egypt-students-military-court-20141116192057805603.html">prosecuted</a>&#xA0;by the military courts. These trials contained almost no evidence and were based on investigations led by National Security officers. <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/topics/organisations/human-rights-watch.html">Human Rights Watch</a> said that this &#x201C;formed the basis of 7,400 or more military trials of civilians&#x201D; since Sisi issued the decree.</p>
<p>A few years into Egypt&#x2019;s new authoritarianism, citizens have been herded away from the&#xA0;<a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/11/egyptian-police-arrest-scores-anti-sisi-protesters-161111143613338.html">public space</a>&#xA0;that has been shrinking thanks to government&#x2019;s crackdown on independent civil society organisations and opposition political parties.</p>
<p>In 2016, a&#xA0;<a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/12/egypt-media-law-161227064051239.html">new law</a>&#xA0;signed by Sisi ordered the creation of a Supreme Council for the Administration of the Media, a body that can revoke licences to foreign media and fine or suspend publications and broadcasters.</p>
<p>The&#xA0;<a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2016/11/egypt-anti-protest-law-legalising-authoritarianism-161107095415334.html">anti-protest law</a>&#xA0;passed in 2013 remains in place. It effectively banned anti-government protests, but the Supreme Constitutional Court is legally challenging it.</p>
<p>In 2016, Egypt also approved an&#xA0;<a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2017/02/egypt-ngo-law-aims-erase-civil-society-170215121321442.html">NGO bill</a>&#xA0;that required all centres to register as non-profits regardless of what service they provide. It aims to restrict civil society organisations and their activities, which will be subject to security intervention according to the bill.</p>
