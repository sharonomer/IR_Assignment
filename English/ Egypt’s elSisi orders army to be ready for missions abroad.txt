<p>Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi has ordered his army to be ready to carry out missions inside or outside the country to protect its national security amid tensions over Turkey&#x2019;s intervention in neighbouring Libya.</p>
<p>He also warned forces loyal to the internationally recognised Government of National Accord (GNA) in Tripoli not to cross the current front line between them and renegade commander Khalifa Haftar&#x2019;s eastern-based self-styled Libyan National Army (LNA).</p>
<p>The GNA, with Turkish support, has reversed a 14-month assault on the capital by the LNA.</p>
<p>The LNA is backed by Russia, the United Arab Emirates and Egypt.</p>
<p>El-Sisi on Saturday toured an airbase near Egypt&#x2019;s 1,200km-long (746-mile) western border with Libya, where state television showed him watching fighter jets and helicopters taking off.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Be prepared to carry out any mission, here inside our borders &#x2013; or if necessary, outside our borders,&#x201D; he told air&#xA0;force pilots and special forces personnel at the base.</p>
<p>He said the Egyptian army was &#x201C;one of the strongest in the region&#x201D;, adding: &#x201C;It is a rational army; an army that protects and does not threaten &#x2026; this is our strategy, our beliefs and our principles that we will never change.&#x201D;</p>
<p>He also said Egypt did not want to intervene in Libya and generally favoured a political solution, but added that &#x201C;the situation now is different&#x201D;.</p>
<p>&#x201C;If some people think that they can cross the Sirte-Jufra front line, this is a red line for us,&#x201D; he said before an audience that included some Libyan tribal leaders.</p>
<p>&#x201C;If the Libyan people moved through you and asked us to intervene, this would be a signal to the world that Egypt and Libya are one country, one interest,&#x201D; he added.</p>

<h2>Turkey urges Haftar withdrawal</h2>
<p>Meanwhile, Turkey said on Saturday that Haftar&#x2019;s forces in eastern Libya needed to withdraw from the strategic city of Sirte for a lasting ceasefire.</p>
<p>Ibrahim Kalin, the presidential spokesman, told AFP news agency that Haftar&#x2019;s forces should leave Sirte and Jufra in order to have a &#x201C;sustainable ceasefire&#x201D;.</p>
<p>Kalin said a ceasefire in Libya would be possible if all parties returned to their 2015 positions, referring to an agreement reached that year.</p>
<p>He warned against a rushed truce, saying: &#x201C;A rushed, premature ceasefire will not lead to what we want to achieve for all Libyans there.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Earlier this month, Egypt called for a ceasefire in Libya as part of an initiative which also proposed an elected leadership council for the country.</p>
<p>The United States, Russia and the UAE welcomed the plan. Germany said United Nations-backed talks were key to the peace process.</p>
<p>However, Turkey dismissed the proposal as an attempt to save Haftar following a string of losses on the battlefield.</p>
<p>Libya has been mired in chaos since a NATO-backed 2011 uprising toppled longtime leader Muammar Gaddafi, with rival governments fighting for control of the country&#x2019;s oil wealth.</p>
