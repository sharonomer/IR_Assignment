<p>US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo expressed outrage during a meeting with Egyptian President <a href="/topics/people/abdel-fattah-el-sisi.html">Abdel-Fattah el-Sisi</a> over the death of a imprisoned American citizen.</p>
<p>Pompeo derided the &#x201C;pointless and tragic death&#x201D; of US national Moustafa Kassem following his protracted hunger strike, a US official said on Sunday.</p>
<p>The <a href="/topics/country/united-states.html">United States</a> confirmed the death of Egyptian-American Kassem in a prison last week in <a href="/topics/country/egypt.html">Egypt</a>, where he had been in custody since 2013, and promised to continue to raise concerns over Cairo&#x2019;s human rights record.</p>
<p>An Egyptian presidency statement on the el-Sisi-Pompeo meeting made no mention of Kassem&#x2019;s case.</p>
<p>Pompeo&#x2019;s sharp remarks signal the US government intended to place the death of Kassem, 54, high on the diplomatic agenda on the sidelines of an<a href="/news/2020/01/world-powers-meet-berlin-discuss-libya-crisis-200119023145417.html"> international peace summit in Berlin</a>&#xA0;aiming to end Libya&#x2019;s civil war.</p>
<p>The death of the auto-parts dealer from Long Island, New York prompted an outcry from human rights groups, as well as accusations of medical negligence in Egypt&#x2019;s prisons.</p>
<p>The case also touched a nerve in Washington, which has cultivated close security and diplomatic ties with Egypt despite growing unease over its human rights violations under general-turned-president el-Sisi.</p>
<p>Activists and foreign affairs experts have called on the Trump administration to penalise its staunch Middle Eastern ally by slashing millions of dollars in security assistance. The US grants $1.2bn in annual military aid to Egypt.</p>
<p>Kassem was detained by Egypt in 2013 in what his lawyers described as a vast dragnet during the violent dispersal of a protester sit-in that killed hundreds of people. He was later sentenced to 15 years under a contentious anti-protest law the government often uses to silence dissent.</p>
<p>He maintained his innocence throughout his detention and started a hunger strike last year in protest.</p>
<p>El-Sisi came to power in the summer of 2013 and has overseen a sweeping crackdown on dissent, jailing thousands.</p>
