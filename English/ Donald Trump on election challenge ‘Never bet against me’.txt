<p>US President Donald Trump laid out a detailed scenario in which he believes he can wrest an election victory from President-elect Joe Biden, declaring &#x201C;Never bet against me.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Trump, who has not conceded the race nor has spoken publicly since November 5, <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/byron-yorks-daily-memo-newsletter-exclusive-trump-talks-post-election-fight" target="_blank">described</a> during a Thursday phone call with conservative Washington Examiner columnist Byron York how he sees recounts and litigation changing the outcome in his favour.</p>
<p>&#x201C;We&#x2019;re going to win Wisconsin,&#x201D; he told York, even though he is behind by just more than 20,000 votes out of nearly 3.3 million cast. It is expected Trump will call for a recount there next week. In 2016, Trump won Wisconsin by 22,478 votes out of almost three million cast and a recount that year affected only 131 votes &#x2013; in his favour.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Arizona &#x2013; it&#x2019;ll be down to 8,000 votes, and if we can do an audit of the millions of votes, we&#x2019;ll find 8,000 votes easy. If we can do an audit, we&#x2019;ll be in good shape there,&#x201D; Trump continued.</p>

<p>He expressed confidence he will win Georgia after the hand recount of votes that began Friday. &#x201C;We&#x2019;re down to about 10,000, 11,000 votes, and we have hand counting.&#x201D;</p>
<p>With Michigan and Pennsylvania, &#x201C;the two big states&#x201D;, Trump explained his chances hinge on a series of lawsuits his campaign has filed.</p>

<p>Trump also spoke to pro-Trump journalist Geraldo Rivera, who appears regularly on Fox News, telling Rivera that he is a &#x201C;&#x2018;realist&#x2019; who&#x2019;ll do the &#x2018;right thing&apos;&#x201D; but wants to see how the lawsuits and recounts play out.</p>

<p>Trump on Friday tweeted more unsubstantiated claims again declaring the election &#x201C;rigged.&#x201D; Twitter almost immediately labeled the claims in his tweet &#x201C;disputed&#x201D; as it has done with many the president&#x2019;s tweets since Election Day.</p>
<p>&#x201C;For years the Dems have been preaching how unsafe and rigged our elections have been,&#x201D; Trump wrote. &#x201C;Now they are saying what a wonderful job the Trump Administration did in making 2020 the most secure election ever. Actually this is true, except for what the Democrats did. Rigged Election!&#x201D;</p>

<p>While most Republicans are giving Trump the runway to let his challenges play out, most election law experts and legal observers argue that Trump&#x2019;s legal claims are baseless and are destined to fail. And it is not just legal experts who are not giving Trump much of a chance.</p>
<p>The conservative York called it &#x201C;definitely an optimistic scenario &#x2013; and one at odds with the current state of the race&#x201D; and added, &#x201C;indeed, the picture looks bleak for the president&#x201D;.</p>
<p>Karl Rove, former President George W Bush&#x2019;s campaign manager during the contested 2000 presidential election that ended up in Bush&#x2019;s favour, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/this-election-result-wont-be-overturned-11605134335" target="_blank">wrote</a> this week in the Wall Street Journal about Trump&#x2019;s manoeuvres: &#x201C;certainly they&#x2019;re not enough to change the final outcome&#x201D;.</p>
<p>&#x201C;To win, Mr. Trump must prove systemic fraud, with illegal votes in the tens of thousands. There is no evidence of that so far,&#x201D; Rove argued.</p>
