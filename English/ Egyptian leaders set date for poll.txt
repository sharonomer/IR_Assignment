<p>Officials on Sunday said the chosen candidate will subsequently be put for approval to the people at a referendum in September.</p>
<p>It is still not clear whether President Husni Mubarak, in power for 23 years, will seek a fifth term, although parliament has passed a motion in support of his candidacy.</p>
<p>&#x201C;The nomination on the president of the republic by the People&#x2019;s Assembly will take place in May, at the end of the current parliamentary session, and the presidential referendum in September,&#x201D; Safwat al-Sharif, secretary-general of the ruling National Democratic Party, said.</p>
<p><strong>Election process</strong></p>
<p>Egypt chooses its president in a two-stage process&#xA0;&#x2013; first, the parliament dominated by the ruling party must choose a candidate with a two-thirds majority and then the name is put to a popular vote in a referendum.</p>
<p>However, the opposition has long called for constitutional reform to allow the president to be chosen from a list of candidates by universal suffrage, as well as a reduction of the presidential mandate.</p>
<p>The presidential mandate in Egypt lasts six years, but there is no limit on how many times the person can stand. The country has been under a state of emergency since president Anwar Sadat was assassinated in 1981.</p>
<p>In a rare sign of dissent, about 300 people demonstrated in Cairo last month against the possibility of Mubarak running for a fifth term in office, denouncing what they called a &#x201C;hereditary presidency&#x201D;.</p>
