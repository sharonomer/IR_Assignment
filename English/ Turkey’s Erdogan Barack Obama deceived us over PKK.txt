<p>Turkey&#x2019;s <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/topics/people/recep-tayyip-erdogan.html">President Recep Tayyip Erdogan</a> is planning to meet his US counterpart <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/topics/people/donald-trump.html">Donald Trump</a> next month, hoping for stronger ties with the United States after being &#x201C;deceived&#x201D; by ex-President Barack Obama.</p>
<p>Erdogan made the comments in an interview with Al Jazeera that was broadcast on Wednesday, three days after he hailed a&#xA0;<a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/04/turkey-recep-tayyip-erdogan-hails-referendum-victory-170416210129492.html">&#x201C;Yes vote&#x201D; in a referendum</a>&#xA0;to amend Turkey&#x2019;s constitution and grant the country&#x2019;s presidential office new executive powers.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Trump&#xA0;congratulated us for the referendum and the final vote,&#x201D; Erdogan said.</p>

<p>&#x201C;The most important point we discussed was about developments in Syria and Iraq. We plan to meet in May and we will discuss things further face to face.</p>
<p>Erdogan also criticised Trump&#x2019;s predecessor over an agreement between the two to fight what he described as &#x201C;terrorist groups&#x201D; operating in Turkey.</p>
<p>&#x201C;With President Obama, we had a mutual agreement about the <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/topics/organisations/pkk.html">PKK</a> &#x2013; but Obama deceived us. I don&#x2019;t believe the Trump administration will do the same.&#x201D;</p>
<p>The Kurdistan Workers&#x2019; Party, or PKK, has been designated a &#x201C;terrorist&#x201D; group by Turkey,&#xA0;the European Union and the US. It launched an armed struggle against the Turkish state in 1984 and more than 40,000 people have since been killed in the conflict.</p>
<p>In February this year, Turkish police <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/02/turkey-hundreds-detained-alleged-links-pkk-170214162131411.html">detained more than 800 people</a> over alleged links to Kurdish fighters in nationwide operations, according to state media.</p>
<p>In <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/syria.html">Syria</a>, the US backs the Syrian-Kurdish YPG armed group battling ISIL, which stands for Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, and is also known as <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/topics/organisations/isis-isil.html">ISIS</a>.</p>
<p>But Turkey considers the YPG to be a &#x201C;terrorist group&#x201D;, linked with the PKK, and a threat to its security.</p>
<p>&#x201C;The YPG is an arm of the PKK. We must put an end to this,&#x201D; said Erodgan.</p>
<p>&#x201C;We can&#x2019;t destroy one terrorist group with another one. We are strategic partners with the US.&#x201D;</p>

<p>On Sunday, 51.4 percent of Turks voted &#x201C;Yes&#x201D; to approve changes to their constitution and grant the country&#x2019;s presidential office extensive executive powers, according to unofficial results.</p>
<p>The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE)&#xA0;said a &#x201C;lack of equal opportunities, one-sided media coverage and limitations on fundamental freedoms&#x201D; had created an &#x201C;unlevel playing field&#x201D; in Turkey&#x2019;s vote.</p>
<p>Erdogan, however, told international election observers to&#xA0;&#x201C;<a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/04/president-erdogan-rejects-criticism-referendum-170417183741623.html">talk to the hand</a>&#x201D; following the criticism, saying&#xA0;concentrating power in the hands of the president was vital to prevent instability.&#xA0;</p>
<p>On Wednesday, Turkey&#x2019;s Supreme Election Board rejected petitions submitted by three political parties asking for the constitutional referendum to be cancelled after <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/04/chp-blasts-election-board-referendum-result-170417034950684.html">citing voting irregularities</a>.</p>
<p>The petitions were filed by main opposition Republican People&#x2019;s Party, People&#x2019;s Democracy Party and Patriotic Party.</p>
<p>Ten out of 11 board members voted against the appeals, the board said in a statement.&#xA0;</p>
