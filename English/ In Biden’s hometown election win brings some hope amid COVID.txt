<p><strong>Wilmington, Delaware</strong> &#x2013; Used electric guitars line the walls and old cameras, laptops and gold jewellery fill the display cases of Tony Farrace&#x2019;s dusty second-hand shop on Market Street.</p>
<p>Facing economic woes due to the COVID-19 pandemic, more and more residents have come to the store in Wilmington&#x2019;s central business district to turn in valuables in exchange for cash, Farrace said.</p>
<p>In recent weeks, though, another scene has developed across the street from the shop&#x2019;s doors.</p>
<p>Secret Service officers, donning suits and ear-pieces, are standing guard at The Queen theatre, a music venue that has been converted into Joe Biden&#x2019;s temporary headquarters as he prepares to enter the White House.</p>
<p>With COVID-19 continuing to hit communities across the United States hard, people in Wilmington &#x2013; widely considered Biden&#x2019;s hometown &#x2013; are hoping the US president-elect will be able to both stem the pandemic and give them the support they need.</p>
<p>&#x201C;I tell them (politicians) what they ought to do is spend the day in here and see the people and how they live,&#x201D; Farrace, 75, told Al Jazeera.</p>
<h2>&#x2018;Mi casa es su casa&#x2019;</h2>
<p>While he was born in Scranton, Pennsylvania, Biden grew up in Wilmington and later attended the University of Delaware.</p>
<p>After studying law at Syracuse University, he returned to Wilmington, where he got involved in politics &#x2013; and in 1972, Biden became one of the youngest people ever elected to the US Senate at the age of 29.</p>
<p>For more than 35 years as a US senator, Biden commuted by train almost daily from the city to Washington, DC, retaining a local presence even as his stature in national politics grew. After he became vice president in 2008, the city&#x2019;s train station was named for him.</p>
<p>In the presidential election, Biden <a href="https://interactive.aljazeera.com/aje/live-results-us-election-day-2020/index.html">won the state</a> with 58.7 percent support, compared with 39.8 percent for President Donald Trump.</p>

<p>In the shop owner&#x2019;s case, his father, John, knew the next US president personally.</p>
<p>&#x201C;When Joe&#x2019;s mom passed away, he had a limousine pick my father up and bring him to the church for the service,&#x201D; Farrace recalled, referring to Biden by his first name.</p>
<p>Nowadays, Biden and US Vice President-elect Kamala Harris use Wilmington&#x2019;s historic theatre to host virtual meetings with national security officials, public health experts and others in preparation for their entry into the White House.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Mi casa es su casa,&#x201D; Biden joked recently &#x2013; &#x201C;My house is your house&#x201D; &#x2013; as he welcomed top Democratic congressional leaders to The Queen for a face-to-face meeting.</p>

<h2>Promises to be tested</h2>
<p>During the course of his career, the loss and resilience Biden experienced in his personal life &#x2013; he lost his wife and daughter in a car crash in 1972 and his son, Beau, died in 2015 of brain cancer &#x2013; informed his public work for Delaware, and later, the country.</p>
<p>Biden is widely known as one of the most accessible politicians on the national scene.</p>
<p>This sense of empathy became an important part of his campaign for the presidency, offering Americans struggling with losses from the pandemic empathy and a promise that &#x201C;we will get through this.&#x201D;</p>

<p>The virus has surged across the country in recent weeks, with record daily numbers of new cases recorded amid an uptick in deaths and hospitalisations.</p>
<p>Some states have reimposed tough restrictions on their economies in an attempt to limit the spread of COVID-19, but negotiations in Congress about a new economic relief package have made little progress.</p>
<p>Delaware has <a href="https://coronavirus.delaware.gov/">reported</a> over 34,000 cases of COVID-19 since the pandemic began &#x2013; the positive test rate is 363.1 per 10,000 people &#x2013; and a total of 763 people have died from the virus so far.</p>
<p>This week, Governor John Carney extended a state of emergency that limits non-essential businesses and orders all residents to shelter in place, among other measures. &#x201C;We are in a resurgence, and we need to stay vigilant to limit the spread of this virus,&#x201D; Carney <a href="https://news.delaware.gov/2020/11/25/governor-carney-formally-extends-state-of-emergency-6/">said</a>.</p>
<h2>&#x2018;We need help&#x2019;</h2>
<p>Tim Pawliczek, the owner of Cavanaugh&#x2019;s Restaurant, a block from The Queen theatre, said his business was down 70 percent due to the pandemic.</p>
<p>He said he has kept the restaurant open thanks to a grant from the state and a skeleton crew of four, including himself. With the election, there&#x2019;s been a little bit of business from the foreign press covering Biden and some take-out traffic.</p>
<p>&#x201C;We are just fighting to survive,&#x201D; the 53-year-old told Al Jazeera, adding that he hoped US politicians &#x201C;would stop fighting with each other and come up with a programme&#x201D; to help people who are struggling.</p>
<p>Pawliczek said he Biden to take the bipartisan approach he promised in the campaign. &#x201C;I hope he does a great job. I am pulling for him,&#x201D; he said.</p>

<p>&#x201C;We had a line out the door. We got crushed,&#x201D; said Joe Van Horn, 57, who noted state restrictions on crowds limited the bar&#x2019;s patrons to 50 people, however. The venue has been operating at a third of its usual capacity, he said.</p>
<p>Van Horn is a member at St Joseph&#x2019;s on the Brandywine, a historic Catholic church where Beau Biden is buried and where the US president-elect often attends Sunday mass.</p>
<p>Van Horn has a picture of Biden with his wife and daughter taken 16 years ago and said he remembers the day well. Jill Biden was hosting a fundraiser at a restaurant he was managing and Biden, then a US senator, showed up.</p>

<p>A drunken patron stumbled out the back door, bumped into Biden and said, &#x201C;Oh my mom loves you&#x201D;, before putting him on the phone with her. Biden talked to the woman enthusiastically for about 10 minutes, Van Horn said.</p>
<p>When Biden won the election, &#x201C;everybody in Delaware started posting pictures of themselves and Joe Biden on Facebook,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;Literally, everyone has a picture with Joe Biden. He&#x2019;s very accessible.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Like others here, Van Horn said he welcomed the news of Biden&#x2019;s impending presidency. &#x201C;Hopefully, we&#x2019;ll get some perks out of it,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;We need help.&#x201D;</p>
