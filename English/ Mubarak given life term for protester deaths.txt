<p><strong>CAIRO, Egypt &#x2013;</strong> An Egyptian court has&#xA0;sentenced former president Hosni Mubarak to life in prison for complicity in killing more than 800 protesters during last year&#x2019;s revolution, a first in the Arab world and a major achievement for the revolution which toppled him nearly 18 months ago.</p>
<p>Judge Ahmed Refaat acknowledged problems with the prosecution&#x2019;s case, which was widely criticised by legal experts.</p>
<p>Prosecutors did not present evidence that Mubarak, 84,&#xA0;directly ordered the killings. But Refaat faulted the former president for not stopping them, and delivered a speech during Saturday&#x2019;s court session about what he called the &#x201C;dark days&#x201D; of Mubarak&#x2019;s rule.</p>
<p>The judge&#xA0;stressed several times that the protesters last year were non-violent.</p>
<p>&#x201C;They marched peacefully towards Tahrir Square, demanding justice, freedom and democracy,&#x201D; he said.</p>
<p>The verdict at first drew an ecstatic reaction from a small crowd gathered outside the Cairo police academy, the site of the trial. Many of the demonstrators had family members killed during the revolution.</p>
<p>There was no way to watch the trial from outside the police academy, so the crowd huddled around cars and portable radios to listen.</p>
<p>When the judge read Mubarak&#x2019;s sentence, a huge cheer erupted from the crowd; some people fired sparklers into the air, while others fell to their knees to pray.</p>
<p>One elderly couple knelt on a poster bearing a photograph of their dead son, crying and shouting: &#x201C;God is great.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;I thank God. I thank God, and I thank the judge. This is a victory for all the Egyptian people &#x2026; this will not make [my son] come back, but this is just,&#x201D; said Umm Saber, whose son was killed by security forces last January.</p>
<h3><span style="font-size:13px">Joy turns to fury</span></h3>
<p>But among many in the crowd, the initial excitement quickly gave way to scepticism and frustration over the extent of Mubarak&#x2019;s sentence and&#xA0;the acquittal of four aides.</p>

<p>Some people had hoped for a death sentence. &#x201C;He should hang,&#x201D; said Umm Farouq. &#x201C;He kills the Egyptian people for being hungry, and now he can live in prison, in comfort.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Mubarak has been held since last year not in prison, but in a military hospital, which many local media reports have described as a comfortable facility.</p>
<p>The president was brought to Tora prison after the verdict, and reportedly initially&#xA0;refused to leave his helicopter; state media reported that he had been admitted to the prison&#x2019;s hospital after eventually disembarking from the aircraft.</p>
<p>Habib el-Adly, Mubarak&#x2019;s longtime interior minister, was also sentenced to life in prison for his role in the killings.</p>
<p>Many people had expected him to receive a death sentence.</p>
<p>Several of Adly&#x2019;s top aides, including the former heads of Cairo security and the notorious Central Security Forces, were acquitted of any role in killing protesters.</p>
<p><strong>&#x2018;Bankrupted this country&#x2019;</strong></p>
<p>Mubarak was acquitted on corruption charges. His two sons, Gamal and Alaa, were also acquitted, a ruling that prompted anger outside the courtroom.</p>

<p>&#x201C;They bankrupted this country and now they are free?&#x201D; one man yelled incredulously into a loudspeaker.</p>
<p>The judge said those charges were dismissed because they dealt with crimes which occurred more than a decade ago. </p>
<p>Gamal and Alaa will remain in custody, however, because they were charged earlier this week with stock market fraud.</p>
<p>&#x201C;They can just take the money they stole and, whoosh,&#x201D; said Mustafa al-Helmy, using his hands to mimic a running man.</p>
<p>A small group of pro-Mubarak demonstrators held their own rally outside the police academy, separated from the victim&#x2019;s families by hundreds of police officers and dozens of armoured vehicles.</p>
<p>One of them held a sign proclaiming Mubarak &#x201C;a hero of peace and war&#x201D;.</p>
<p>&#x201C;He was a great man who fought for his country,&#x201D; said a man who gave his name only as Ahmed. &#x201C;They [the opposition] just want revenge, but this is not justice.&#x201D;</p>
<h3><span style="font-size:13px">&#x2018;His right hand becomes president&#x2019;</span></h3>
<p>Following the announcement of the verdict, several groups called for protests to be held across the country.</p>
<p>By mid-afternoon, hundreds of people had converged on Cairo&#x2019;s Tahrir Square, with larger crowds expected in the evening.</p>
<p>Almost 1,000 people staged a separate march to the supreme court, where they threw rocks and broke windows.</p>
<p>There were also protests in the northern city of Alexandria, where thousands gathered shouting slogans against Mubarak, demanding that he face the death penalty, Al Jazeera&#x2019;s Jamal Elshayyal reported.</p>
<p>The Muslim Brotherhood released a statement calling the verdict shocking&#x201D; to &#x201C;the families of the martyrs&#x201D;.</p>
<p>The group said it would participate in protests on Saturday.</p>
<p>Ahmed Shafiq, one of the two candidates in the presidential runoff later this month, released his own statement, which said the verdict proved that &#x201C;no one is above accountability&#x201D;.</p>
<p><strong>Presidential factor</strong></p>
<p>The sentence will present a political question for the next president, once he is elected after a June 16-17 runoff.</p>
<p>Many Egyptians expect Shafiq to pardon Mubarak if he wins. Mohammed Morsi, the Muslim Brotherhood&#x2019;s candidate, vowed this week to keep the former president in prison &#x201C;forever&#x201D;.</p>

<p>&#x201C;The public prosecutor did not carry out its full duty in gathering adequate evidence to convict the accused for killing<br>protesters,&#x201D; said Yasser Ali, campaign spokesman for Morsi.</p>
<p>Many of the demonstrators outside the police academy quickly linked the verdict to the runoff election. Some said Shafiq should have joined Mubarak and Adly in the dock.</p>
<p>&#x201C;He isn&#x2019;t the only one,&#x201D; said Karim al-Azazi, referring to Mubarak.</p>
<p>&#x201C;SCAF [the country&#x2019;s&#xA0;ruling military council] has killed so many of us.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Remember Abbasiyya. Remember Mohamed Mahmoud,&#x201D; he said, referring to two major confrontations with security forces in recent months.</p>
<p>More than 40 people were killed during the week-long clashes on Mohamed Mahmoud street in November, and nine people were killed in Abbasiyya, near the defence ministry, in May.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Mubarak goes to jail, but his right hand becomes president,&#x201D; he said, shaking his head.</p>
