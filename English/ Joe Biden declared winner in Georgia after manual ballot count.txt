<p>United States President-elect Joe Biden has officially been declared the winner in the state of Georgia, flipping the historically Republican-voting state for the Democratic Party for the first time in decades.</p>
<p>The Associated Press news agency said late Thursday that Biden had secured Georgia&#x2019;s 16 Electoral College votes, stretching his lead to 306 Electoral College votes compared to US President Donald Trump&#x2019;s 232.</p>
<p>The news agency declared Biden the winner of the tightly contested US presidential elections on November 7 after the former US vice president won key states Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin &#x2013; but the state of Georgia had been too close to call.</p>
<p>The AP&#x2019;s victory call comes just after Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger&#x2019;s office announced that a manual audit of the presidential contest results had confirmed Biden&#x2019;s narrow lead over Trump.</p>
<p>A hand tally of about five million votes was carried out under an audit required by a Georgia state law, AP reported &#x2013; and not due to any problems with election procedures or an official recount request.</p>
<p>The state has until Friday to certify results that have been certified and submitted by the counties, the news agency said.</p>
<p>The result of Georgia hand count came after the Trump campaign filed a slew of lawsuits in key states across the US, as the Republican president has alleged, without any evidence, that widespread voter fraud marred the elections.</p>

<h2>&#x2018;Historic&#x2019; audit</h2>
<p>Raffensperger welcomed the results of the state&#x2019;s manual count on Thursday evening, calling the process &#x201C;historic&#x201D;.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Georgia&#x2019;s historic first statewide audit reaffirmed that the state&#x2019;s new secure paper ballot voting system accurately counted and reported results,&#x201D; he said in <a href="https://sos.ga.gov/index.php/elections/historic_first_statewide_audit_of_paper_ballots_upholds_result_of_presidential_race">a statement</a> posted on his website.</p>
<p>&#x201C;This is a credit to the hard work of our county and local elections officials who moved quickly to undertake and complete such a momentous task in a short period of time.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Raffensperger&#x2019;s office said that because Biden&#x2019;s margin of victory is less than 0.5 percent, the Trump campaign can request a recount after the results are certified.</p>
<p>&#x201C;That recount will be conducted by rescanning all paper ballots,&#x201D; the statement reads.</p>

<p>Ben Adida, executive director of VotingWorks, a bipartisan non-profit group that helps states conduct election audits, said the Georgia audit confirming Biden as the winner &#x201C;should give voters increased confidence in the results&#x201D;.</p>
<p>&#x201C;The difference between the reported results and the full manual tally is well within the expected error rate of hand-counting ballots, and the audit was a success,&#x201D; Adida said in the Georgia secretary of state&#x2019;s statement.</p>
<p>Votes that had not previously been counted were found in several counties during the Georgia audit, which required recertification of the election results in those counties, the AP reported.</p>
<p>The news agency said that in Floyd County, in the state&#x2019;s northwest, more than 2,500 ballots were discovered during the audit that had not previously been scanned &#x2013; and Raffensperger&#x2019;s office had called for the firing of the county&#x2019;s chief elections clerk.</p>
<p>Several other counties found memory cards with votes that had not been uploaded and counted prior to the audit, AP also said.</p>
