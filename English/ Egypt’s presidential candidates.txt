<p>A long-time member of Mubarak&#x2019;s cabinet, the 72-year old Shafiq served for 33 days as the former president&#x2019;s final prime minister.</p>
<p>After a long career in the air force, Shafiq was appointed as minister of civil aviation in 2002, a position he held until 2011. </p>
<p>During his last attempts to quell protests, Mubarak promoted Shafiq to the post of prime minister.</p>
<p>Shafiq was running the government when protesters in Tahrir Square were attacked on February 2 last&#xA0;year&#xA0;by armed men riding on horses and camels.</p>
<p>He&#xA0;was disqualified by the election commission for his associtation with the former regime, but&#xA0;a last minute appeal saw the decision reversed.</p>
<p>Because of his long military career, many reportedly believe Shafiq is the military&#x2019;s choice in the race.</p>

<p>He has denied that his mother had US citizenship, saying it is a conspiracy against him. </p>
