<p>Egyptian President <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/topics/people/abdel-fattah-el-sisi.html">Abdel Fattah el-Sisi</a> received a royal welcome from King Salman as he landed on Sunday in <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/saudi-arabia.html">Saudi Arabia</a> for a visit to boost ties after months of tension.</p>
<p>Salman, surrounded by key Saudi officials, greeted Sisi as he stepped off the plane in the capital Riyadh and hosted him for lunch, the official Saudi Press Agency said.</p>
<p>The Egyptian presidency announced the visit in a statement on Friday, saying Sisi&#x2019;s trip was in response to an invitation by Salman and aimed at &#x201C;bolstering strategic relations between the two countries&#x201D;.&#xA0;</p>

<p>It said Salman and Sisi would discuss &#x201C;regional and international issues of common interest&#x201D;.</p>
<p>&#x201C;The struggle against terrorism which threatens security and stability&#x201D; in the region and beyond would top their agenda, it said.</p>
<p>Sisi met Salman on the sidelines of an Arab League summit in Jordan last month to break the ice after months of apparent tensions between the two Middle Eastern allies.</p>
<p>That encounter on March 29 came days after <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/egypt.html">Egypt</a> announced that Saudi energy giant Aramco had resumed delivering shipments of petroleum products after abruptly suspending them in October.</p>
<p>Aramco halted agreed monthly deliveries of 700,000 tonnes of petroleum products without explanation.</p>
<p>But the move came after Egypt voted in favour of a Russian-drafted UN Security Council resolution on <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/syria.html">Syria</a> that Saudi Arabia strongly opposed.</p>
<p>&#x201C;These are two former giants in the region who are trying to regain their roles, and they understand that by working together they can help each other,&#x201D; Rami Khouri, a senior public policy fellow with the Issam Fares Institute at the American University of Beirut, told Al Jazeera.</p>

<p>Moscow is a staunch supporter of Syrian President <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/topics/people/bashar-al-assad.html">Bashar al-Assad</a> while Riyadh is a key backer of the rebels who are fighting his government.</p>
<p>Ties between Cairo and Riyadh also suffered after an agreement to hand over to Saudi Arabia two Red Sea islands &#x2013; signed during a visit by Salman to Cairo last year &#x2013; was blocked by a court ruling.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, an <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/01/court-rejects-red-sea-islands-transfer-saudi-arabia-170116093431768.html">Egyptian court ruled</a>&#xA0;the decision to block the transfer of Tiran and Sanafir to Saudi Arabia was invalid.</p>
<p>Cairo has said the islands were Saudi territory that had been leased to Egypt in the 1950s.</p>
<p>Saudi Arabia supported Egypt with billions of dollars in aid after Sisi toppled President <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/06/profile-egypt-deposed-president-mohamed-morsi-160607074148919.html">Mohamed Morsi</a> in 2013 when he was head of the Egyptian army.</p>
<p>Saudi Arabia is opposed to the now-outlawed <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/topics/organisations/muslim-brotherhood.html">Muslim Brotherhood</a>, to which Morsi belongs.</p>
