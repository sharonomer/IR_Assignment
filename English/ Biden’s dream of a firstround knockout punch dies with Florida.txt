<p><strong>Orlando, Florida</strong> &#x2013; President Donald Trump&#x2019;s victory in Florida on election night kept his chances for a second term alive but unlike past presidential election cycles, this race will not hinge on the Sunshine State.</p>
<p>With 96 percent of precincts reporting, Trump beat Biden in Florida, 51.3 percent to 47.8.</p>
<p>Democratic nominee Joe Biden, 77, had a chance for a first-round knockout punch with Florida. He swung hard but missed. Trump&#x2019;s campaign needed Florida&#x2019;s 29 Electoral College votes &#x2013; the nation&#x2019;s largest battleground prize &#x2013; to avoid an early night loss on Tuesday and he got them. Despite Florida playing the role of a bellwether for decades, the race for the White House will likely be won or lost someplace else.</p>
<p>Biden made an aggressive Florida play &#x2013; he visited the state in the final days and his wife made a last-minute stop here on election day &#x2013; but his campaign failed to boost turnout enough in the state, particularly in the highly populated blue counties in the southeast.</p>
<p>In Miami-Dade County, a region where Democratic support is traditionally strong, Biden failed to meet expectations, compared with 2016. With 93 percent of precincts reporting, Biden secured just 53.5 percent of the vote; four years ago Hilary Clinton won 63.7 percent.</p>

He would have needed to exceed Clinton in that crowded county to match support for Trump in more conservative parts of the state. To that end, his campaign missed the mark.<p></p>
<p>Early exit poll data suggest Trump&#x2019;s success came from inroads among Latino voters. While Trump is not expected to win a majority of these voters in Florida or nationwide, he did appear to narrow the gap against Biden in parts of the Sunshine State where it mattered.</p>
<h2><strong>&#x2018;Socialist&#x2019; label</strong></h2>
<p>Preliminary exit polls from CNN suggest that support for Biden among Florida Latinos did not match that for Clinton. Biden won just more than 50 percent; Clinton had won more than 60 percent. A significant amount of support for Trump came from Cuban American voters.</p>
<p>The result comes after Trump&#x2019;s campaign heavily invested in Latino outreach for months before election day. The campaign aired ads in Spanish throughout the summer and aimed to tie prominent Democrats who embrace the &#x201C;socialist&#x201D; label to Biden to woo Latinos who fled oppression and economic depression in failed socialist and communist states.</p>

<p>In other parts of the state, Biden did meet turnout expectations, but it just was not enough to make up for lost margins in the southeast.</p>
<p>Biden, for instance, made in-roads in Trump-friendly Sumter County, a region in the centre of the state north of Orlando. The county is home to the largest population of retirees who live in The Villages, a sprawling community for the elderly that consistently votes Republican. Where Clinton won just 29 percent, Biden inched Democratic numbers into the low 30s.</p>
<p>With 92 percent of precincts reporting in Duval County, Biden appears to have beaten Trump, a region Clinton lost.</p>
<p>And in Pinellas County, a notorious swing district that Trump won in 2016 after it voted Democratic for two prior presidential election cycles, Biden holds a narrow lead.</p>
<p>But despite narrowing margins in red districts and winning battlegrounds, it appears, ultimately, to have been a poor showing in Miami-Dade that kept him from winning.</p>
