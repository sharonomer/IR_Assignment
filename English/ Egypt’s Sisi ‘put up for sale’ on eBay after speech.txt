<p><span> A heated speech by Egyptian President&#xA0;</span><span>Abdel Fattah el-Sisi has been widely mocked by Egyptians online, with one of them even putting him &#x201C;up for sale&#x201D; on the auction site eBay. </span></p>
<p>&#x201C;By almighty God, if I could sell myself [to benefit the nation], I would have done it,&#x201D; he said in an address broadcast on state television, in which he revealed a plan for economic growth.</p>

<p>Shortly afterwards, the eBay page was created. Within a few hours, the bidding was at more than $100,000.</p>
<p>The advertisement read:&#xA0;&#x201C;For sale on eBay, Field Marshal, Doctor of Philosophy with a military background, decent condition, current bid $100,301.&#x201D;</p>

<p>The &#x201C;seller&#x201D; wrote that Sisi had been &#x201C;used by the previous owners (Gulf royal families)&#x201D;, and that shipping would free.</p>
<p>The page was later removed.</p>

<div>In his speech the president angrily listed the country&#x2019;s economic problems before asking Egyptians to donate an Egyptian pound, which is about 10 US cents, to a government fund.&#xA0;</div>

<p>He went on to say that what he called unfair criticism of his government could help those trying to topple him.</p>
<p><span class="apple-converted-space"> <span> &#x201C;Please, do not listen to anyone but me. I am dead serious,&#x201D; he said in a loud voice. </span> </span></p>
<p><span class="apple-converted-space"> <span> &#x201C;Be careful, no one should abuse my patience and good manners to bring down the state,&#x201D; he said, adding that he would &#x201C;remove from the face of the Earth&#x201D; anyone plotting to bring down the government.&#xA0;</span></span></p>

<p>As military chief, Sisi led a coup in 2013 against former Mohamed Morsi, Egypt&#x2019;s first freely elected president, whose divisive rule prompted protests.</p>
<p><span> But critics say he has done little to distinguish his rule from that of Morsi, particularly with regard to freedom of expression. </span></p>
<p>Rights groups have compared his rule with that of former President Hosni Mubarak, who in 2011 was himself toppled by a popular uprising driven largely by anger at police brutality.</p>
