<p>Egypt&#x2019;s high court overturned the only remaining conviction against Hosni Mubarak and ordered a retrial in his embezzlement case, opening the way for a possible release from jail for the ousted former president.</p>
<p>Mubarak, 86, was sentenced to three years in prison in May for diverting public funds earmarked to renovate presidential palaces and using the money to upgrade family properties.</p>
<p>His two sons were given four-year jail terms in the same case.</p>
<p>The man who ruled Egypt for 30 years has been serving his sentence in a military hospital in Cairo.</p>
<p>Now that a retrial has been ordered, judicial sources say Mubarak could walk free as no convictions remain against him.</p>
<p>In November, another court dropped charges against Mubarak for conspiring to kill protesters in the 2011 revolt that toppled him from power, and cleared him in two other graft cases.</p>
<p>He faces retrial for a third and final time over charges of involvement in the death of demonstrators.</p>
<p><strong>Anti-Mubarak protests</strong></p>
<p>The decision to drop the charges in November sparked protests at universities across Egypt and prompted mockery online.</p>
<p>At least two people were killed and nine wounded when security forces fired tear gas and birdshot to disperse about 1,000 protesters trying to enter Tahrir Square &#x2013; the symbolic heart of the uprising that ousted Mubarak.</p>

<p>The Court of Cassation, which ordered the retrial on Tuesday, did not say if Mubarak would be freed on bail pending his retrial in the outstanding cases.</p>
<p>Many Egyptians who lived through Mubarak&#x2019;s rule view it as a period of autocracy and crony capitalism.</p>
<p>His overthrow led to Egypt&#x2019;s first free election. But the Islamist victor, Mohamed Morsi, was ousted in 2013 by then-army chief Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, following protests against his rule.</p>
<p>Sisi, who went on to win a presidential election last May, launched a fierce crackdown on Morsi and his Muslim Brotherhood. Authorities have jailed thousands of Brotherhood supporters and sentenced hundreds to death in mass trials that drew international criticism.</p>
<p>By contrast, Mubarak-era figures are slowly being cleared of charges and a series of laws curtailing political freedoms have raised fears among activists that the old leadership is regaining influence.</p>
<p>Tuesday&#x2019;s verdict was seen by political opponents as the latest sign that rights won in 2011 are being eroded.</p>
