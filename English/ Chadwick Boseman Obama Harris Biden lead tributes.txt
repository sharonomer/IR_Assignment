<p>Former President Barack Obama has paid tribute to actor Chadwick Boseman, who portrayed Black American icons Jackie Robinson and James Brown before launching to a new level of fame as the lead in the Black Panther superhero franchise, one of the few films in the Marvel universe to feature a predominantly Black cast.&#xA0;</p>
<p>Boseman died on Friday at the age of 43 after a four-year battle with colon cancer.&#xA0;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Chadwick came to the White House to work with kids when he was playing Jackie Robinson. You could tell right away that he was blessed,&#x201D; Obama wrote on Twitter, referring to the first Black American professional baseball player who Boseman portrayed in the film &#x201C;42&#x201D;.</p>
<p>&#x201C;To be young, gifted, and Black; to use that power to give them heroes to look up to; to do it all while in pain &#x2013; what a use of his years,&#x201D; he wrote.&#xA0;</p>

<p>The president&#x2019;s words were among a litany of memorials posted on social media from elected officials, actors, musicians on Saturday.</p>
<p>&#x201C;A consummate professional, he absorbed every story, every memory and every photo and film excerpt he could consume to help translate the soul of an American hero,&#x201D; said a statement from the Jackie Robinson Foundation.</p>
<p>&#x201C;And now, Chadwick will be etched in history as a hero in his own right, especially have shown millions of Black and brown children the power of a superhero who looks like them. Chadwick &#x2013; may you rest in peace eternally. Take your place among the greats. You earned it,&#x201D; the statement.</p>
<p>Kamala Harris, the Democratic vice-presidential candidate, noted that she and Boseman had attended the same university. &#xA0;</p>

<p>Colleagues also remembered Boseman.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Chadwick was not only a deeply soulful and powerful actor, but he was such a kind, thoughtful, funny and gentle person. He brightened every ones day every time he walked into our hair and makeup trailer or on set with his beautiful smile,&#x201D; actress Scarlett Johansson, who co-starred with Boseman in three Marvel films, said in a statement.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Chadwick&#x2026;..no words to express my devastation of losing you.
