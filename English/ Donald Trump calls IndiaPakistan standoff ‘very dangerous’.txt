<p>US President <a href="/topics/people/donald-trump.html">Donald Trump</a> has voiced concern over the &#x201C;very dangerous situation&#x201D; between <a href="/topics/country/india.html">India</a> and Pakistan following a <a href="/news/2019/02/indian-security-forces-killed-kashmir-blast-reports-190214110644498.html">deadly attack</a> against Indian forces in <a href="/topics/issues/indian-administered-kashmir-141021143036795.html">Kashmir</a>.</p>
<p>&#x201C;It&#x2019;s a very dangerous situation between the two countries,&#x201D; Trump told reporters on Friday in the White House.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Right now there [are] a lot of problems between India and <a href="/topics/country/pakistan.html">Pakistan</a>&#xA0;because of what happened,&#x201D; he said.</p>

<p>Tensions have <a href="/news/2019/02/pakistan-army-respond-full-force-india-attacks-190222104912458.html">soared</a> between the nuclear-armed rivals since a suicide attack last week killed 42 soldiers in Indian-administered Kashmir, the deadliest attack in 30 years of armed rebellion in the Himalayan region.</p>
<p>India has been <a class="InternalLink" href="/news/2019/02/india-allegations-pakistan-evidence-khan-190219082756101.html">demanding</a> action against armed fighters from Pakistan, with Prime Minister <a href="/topics/people/narendra-modi-141021134051524.html">Narendra Modi</a> under pressure from his Hindu nationalist base to show firmness weeks before he is set to call elections.</p>
<p>The attack was claimed by Jaish-e-Mohammad&#xA0;(<a href="/news/2019/02/profile-jaish-muhammad-190215061851082.html">JeM</a>), an armed group based in Pakistan, although the suicide attacker came locally from Indian-administered Kashmir.</p>
<p>Pakistan&#x2019;s military on Friday warned India against any &#x201C;misadventure&#x201D;, saying it was capable of responding.</p>
<p>India and Pakistan have fought two of their three wars over Kashmir since their partition following independence from Britain in 1947.</p>
<p>The Trump administration last year cut off $300m in military aid to Pakistan, saying that Islamabad has not done enough to fight armed rebels at home or close safe havens for fighters in neighbouring <a href="/topics/country/afghanistan.html">Afghanistan</a>.</p>
<p>Trump, however, added the <a href="/topics/country/united-states.html">United States</a> has developed a &#x201C;much better&#x201D; relationship recently with Pakistan and added that the US may set up some meetings with Pakistan.</p>
<p>US envoys say Pakistan has an important role to play in Afghan peace talks, given its links to the <a href="/topics/organisations/taliban.html">Taliban</a>.</p>
