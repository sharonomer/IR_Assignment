<p>Egypt&#x2019;s President Mohamed Morsi&#xA0;has announced that there will be a&#xA0;wide-ranging cabinet reshuffle, but critics say the move is unlikely to meet opposition demands for a complete overhaul of the government.</p>
<p>In an exclusive interview with Al Jazeera on Saturday, Morsi announced the reshuffle, saying that it will involve a number of &#x201C;key ministries&#x201D;.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Government restructuring is not an end, it is a means to achieve public interest,&#x201D; Morsi told Al Jazeera.</p>
<p>&#x201C;So, we will soon see a reshuffle&#xA0;that will include a number of key ministries, mainly to achieve public interest and to react to the changes we face and the problems that arise.&#x201D;</p>
<p>A senior presidential aide has said that the changes to the government will be &#x201C;wide-ranging&#x201D; and include provincial governors, according to the&#xA0;AFP news agency.</p>
<p>&#x201C;The ministries that will be affected include some important ones,&#x201D; he added. &#x201C;I can&#x2019;t mention which ones because, as you know, this is a sensitive matter.&#x201D;</p>
<p><strong>Sacking demand</strong></p>
<p>Al Jazeera&#x2019;s Anita McNaught, reporting from Cairo, said there are few details available about the reshuffle, but that it is unlikely to satisfy the government opposition.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Basically, his critics are saying that his cabinet is not up to the job in total and that they need more competent, more experienced people on the job,&#x201D; she said.</p>
<p>Morsi has repeatedly declared his confidence in Prime Minister Hisham Qandil, whose sacking is demanded by a coalition of opposition groups as a condition for dropping a boycott of parliamentary elections, possibly later this year.</p>
<p>Egyptian newspapers have reported that Morsi may replace Justice Minister Ahmed Mekki and other less-prominent ministers.</p>
<p>The opposition remains steadfast in its demand for a national unity government, in a protracted deadlock with Morsi that has delayed a much needed $4.8bn loan from the International Monetary Fund.</p>
<p>Morsi insists it is up to the next parliament to form a new government.</p>
<p><strong>IMF loan</strong></p>
<p>Qandil&#x2019;s government, appointed after Morsi&#x2019;s election in June, has tried to cope with a hemorrhaging economy despite billions of dollars in aid from energy-rich Qatar and some other countries.</p>
<p>The government says unemployment, a main grievance among young protesters who helped overthrow president Hosni Mubarak in early 2011, has risen since the uprising, while foreign investments and tourism revenues have shrunk.</p>
<p>The Egyptian pound, meanwhile, has dropped by roughly 10 percent to the dollar since December as Qandil&#x2019;s government tries to negotiate the IMF loan it hopes will restore investor confidence in the often restive country.</p>
<p>The loan had been delayed after a wave of protests last winter following Morsi&#x2019;s assumption of extensive powers. Morsi was forced to cancel tax increases, part of the economic reforms demanded by the IMF, to ward off further unrest.</p>
<p>The presidency is expected to unroll cuts to fuel subsidies by next fall, reforms that could possibly stoke an increase in prices and further unrest.</p>
<p>Morsi&#x2019;s supporters have argued that frequent protests, which devolve in clashes with police, are a main obstacle to the country&#x2019;s economic recovery.</p>
