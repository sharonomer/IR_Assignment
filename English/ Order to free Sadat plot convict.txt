<p>Tarek el-Zomor, 45, should have been released in October 2003 after serving 22 years for his part in plotting Sadat&#x2019;s killing during a military parade in Cairo, the court said in a verdict issued on Tuesday. </p>
<p>But the next step is now in the hands of the Interior Ministry, which must either release him or appeal the court&#x2019;s ruling. The ministry last year rejected a similar order by the court to free el-Zomor. </p>
<p>El-Zomor was sentenced to 20 years in prison along with his cousin Leiutenant Colonel Abboud el-Zomor, 57, the maximum term under Egyptian law. </p>

<p>The Interior Ministry has the discretion to hold a prisoner for up to five years or more on security grounds. </p>
<p>Tuesday&#x2019;s ruling did not include the elder el-Zomor. </p>
<p>The two cousins were arrested in October 1981 and convicted in 1984 of plotting Sadat&#x2019;s assassination and belonging to the outlawed Islamic Jihad group, but did not actually shoot the president themselves.</p>
<p>Those who did were captured and executed. </p>
<p>Islamic Jihad, the principal group behind the assassination were opposed to Sadat&#x2019;s 1979 Camp David peace deal with Israel. </p>
<p>In the late 1990s, Islamic Jihad is beleieved to have merged with the al-Qaida group, which is blamed for the September 11 attacks on the United States. </p>
<p>However, in the past few years, many of its jailed leaders have since renounced violence. </p>
