<p>Egypt&#x2019;s Court of Cassation has ordered that former president Hosni Mubarak should be retried over the killing of protesters in 2011.</p>
<p>The judge accepted the public prosecution&#x2019;s appeal against an earlier court ruling that <a class="internallink" href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2014/11/egypt-judge-dismisses-charges-against-mubarak-20141129853635899.html" target="_blank">dropped the case</a> against Mubarak last year. He said the retrial would begin on November 5.</p>
<p>Nearly 900 protesters were killed in the 18-day uprising against the former president&#x2019;s rule that ended when Mubarak stepped down in 2011, handing over power to the military.</p>
<p>The case against Mubarak, however, was concerned only with the killing of 239 protesters, whose names were cited in the charge sheet.</p>
<p>More soon&#x2026;</p>
