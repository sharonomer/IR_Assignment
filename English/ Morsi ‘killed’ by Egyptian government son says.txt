<p>A son of the late former Egyptian President <a href="/topics/people/mohamed-morsi.html">Mohamed Morsi</a> has accused incumbent President <a href="/topics/people/abdel-fattah-el-sisi.html">Abdel Fattah el-Sisi</a> and a number of other officials of &#x201C;killing&#x201D; his father.</p>
<p>Morsi,&#xA0;<a href="/topics/country/egypt.html">Egypt</a>&#x2018;s first democratically elected president who was arrested after being overthrown in a military coup led by el-Sisi in 2013, <a href="/news/2019/06/egypt-president-mohamed-morsi-dies-state-media-190617155322012.html">died</a> on Monday after collapsing inside his soundproof glass cage while on trial in a Cairo courtroom on espionage charges.</p>
<p>In a Twitter post on Thursday, Morsi&#x2019;s son, Abdullah, named a number of officials whom he called &#x201C;partners&#x201D; of el-Sisi &#x201C;in killing the martyr president&#x201D;.</p>
<p>He particularly accused incumbent and former interior ministers Mahmoud Tawfiq and Magdy Abdel Ghaffar, respectively.</p>
<p>He also named judges Shirin Fahmy, Shaaban al-Shami and Ahmed Sabry, as well as Attorney General Nabil Sadek and Abbas Kamel, the head of the intelligence service.</p>
<p>Egyptian authorities have yet to comment on the claims by Morsi&#x2019;s son.</p>
<p>At the time of his death, Morsi &#x2013; a leading member of Egypt&#x2019;s <a href="/indepth/features/2017/06/muslim-brotherhood-explained-170608091709865.html">Muslim Brotherhood</a> who won the country&#x2019;s presidential election in 2012 &#x2013;&#xA0;faced a host of legal charges, which he, along with various <a href="/topics/categories/human_rights.html">human rights</a> groups and independent observers, said were politically motivated.</p>
<h2>&#x2018;He was murdered&#x2019;</h2>
<p>Morsi&#x2019;s death was mourned by many people around the world, including in <a href="/topics/country/turkey.html">Turkey</a>, where mosques held special prayers on Tuesday, while leaders in Malaysia and Qatar were among those offering tributes.</p>
<p>However, the reaction has been largely muted in many capitals.</p>
<p>Turkish President <a href="/topics/people/recep-tayyip-erdogan.html">Recep Tayyip Erdogan</a>, a key ally of Morsi,<span>&#xA0;said this week that the Egyptian government should be&#xA0;<a href="/news/2019/06/erdogan-egypt-government-morsi-death-190620020724346.html">tried in international courts</a> for the death of the former president.</span></p>
<p>&#x201C;Mohamed Morsi flailed on the courtroom floor for 20 minutes and the authorities did not help him. This is why I say Morsi did not die, he was murdered,&#x201D; Erdogan told supporters on Wednesday at an election rally in Istanbul.</p>
<p>&#x201C;We, as Turkey, will follow this issue and do everything possible for Egypt to be tried in international courts for Morsi&#x2019;s death,&#x201D; he said, calling on the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation to take action towards this end.</p>
<p>Since Morsi&#x2019;s removal, relations between Ankara and Cairo have plummeted with acrimonious exchanges.</p>
