<p>Suzanne Mubarak, the wife of ousted Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, has returned some of her assets to the state, after anti-graft officials ordered her detention.</p>
<p>The former first lady returned a villa in the Egyptian capital, Cairo, and transferred the power of attorney on Monday for authorities to withdraw up to $3.4m held in two of her bank accounts, Egyptian state news agency MENA said.</p>
<p>The handover came after the state&#x2019;s anti-corruption agency ordered that Suzanne Mubarak be detained for 15 days for further investigation into charges that she abused her husband&#x2019;s power for unlawful personal gain.</p>
<p>Judicial sources had previously said that her defence team was expected to sign documents ceding her assets in an apparent attempt to avoid detention.</p>
<p>Hosni Mubarak was deposed on February 11 after&#xA0;30 years of rule, in a popular uprising that began a month earlier.</p>
<p>The military council which has been in power since has vowed to bring to justice all those accused of abuse and has launched a sweeping probe into corruption.</p>
<p>Mubarak, his wife, and their two sons, Alaa and Gamal, and wives have been banned from travel and had their assets ordered frozen by the general prosecutor, Abdel Magid Mahmud.</p>
<p>The two sons, along with dozens of officials and businessmen associated with the former regime, are being detained in Cairo&#x2019;s Tora prison which housed political dissidents during the Mubarak era.</p>
<p>The illicit gains department said Mubarak and his wife would also be questioned about properties belonging to their two sons.</p>
<p>The Mubarak family wealth is reported to total billions of dollars, including a villa in the Red Sea resort town of Sharm el-Sheikh, estimated to be worth over $36m.</p>
