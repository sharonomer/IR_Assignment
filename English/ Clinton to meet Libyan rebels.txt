<p>Hillary Clinton, the US secretary of state, is to meet with leaders of Libya&#x2019;s opposition council during a trip to the Middle East next week, she has told US lawmakers.</p>
<p>Clinton&#x2019;s statement of intent comes as France on Thursday became the first major European country to recognise Libya&#x2019;s opposition National Council based in Benghazi as the country&#x2019;s legitimate representative. In a separate joint statement with the United Kingdom, France also called for the Gaddafi &#x201C;clique&#x201D; to leave office.</p>
<p>&#x201C;We are reaching out to the opposition inside and outside of Libya,&#x201D; Clinton said while announcing her trip to Tunisia and Egypt.</p>
<p>&#x201C;I will be meeting with some of those figures, both in the United States and when I travel next week, to discuss what more the United States and others can do,&#x201D; she said.</p>

<p>The opposition council is led by Mustafa Abdel Jalil, the former justice minister, who resigned soon after the Libyan government began a violent crackdown on protesters in February.</p>
<p>Earlier, Gene Cretz, the US Ambassador to Libya, met with opponents of the government led by Muammar Gaddafi.</p>
<p>&#x201C;We are engaging a wide range of leaders, and those who both understand and can potentially influence events in Libya,&#x201D; State Department spokesman Philip Crowley told reporters on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Clinton on Thursday also asserted that there was a need for international consensus on any intervention in Libya, and that a unilateral move by the United States could have &#x201C;unforseeable&#x201D; consequences.</p>
<p>She also expressed doubt that any proposed no-fly zone would Libya would serve to protect citizens effectively, pointing to the examples of previous such measures taken against Iraq and Serbia.</p>
<p>&#x201C;We are working to create an international consensus because we think that is absolutely critical to anything that<br>anybody, especially us, does,&#x201D; Clinton said, saying there was considerable ambivalence over what should be done.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Absent international authorisation, the United States acting alone would be stepping into a situation whose<br>consequences are unforeseeable,&#x201D; Clinton said.</p>
<p>Clinton said the United States was focusing on humanitarian relief and building links to Libya&#x2019;s opposition groups, adding that the State Department had suspended its relations with the Libyan embassy in Washington and that it was expected to &#x201C;end operations as the embassy of Libya&#x201D;.</p>
<p>She also warned that Gaddafi&#x2019;s government was still in possession of &#x201C;chemical weapons&#x201D;.</p>
<p>Jay Carney, the White House&#x2019;s spokesman, said on Thursday that the US government had reached out to Libyan opposition groups, but that it was still in the process of finding out &#x201C;what their vision is, who they represent, what their ideas are and where they would take Libya in a post-Gaddafi future&#x201D;.</p>
<p><strong>Cameron, Sarkozy pressure</strong></p>
<p>David Cameron, the UK&#x2019;s prime minister, and Nicolas Sarkozy, the French president, on Thursday issued a joint statement calling for the Gaddafi government to step down.</p>
<p>&#x201C;To stop further suffering of the Libyan people, Muammar Gaddafi and his&#xA0;clique should leave,&#x201D; they said in a joint letter to Herman Von Rompuy, the European Union president.</p>
<p>&#x201C;We support the efforts of the Libyan Interim Transitional National Council to prepare for a representative and accountable government.</p>
<p>&#x201C;We should send the clear political signal that we consider the Council to be valid political interlocutors, and an important voice for the Libyan people in this phase,&#x201D; they said.</p>
<p><strong>France recognises council</strong></p>
<p>Earlier, France recognised the opposition National Council as the legitimate representatives of the Libyan people.</p>

<p>The move, which will see an ambassador sent to the rebel-held town of Benghazi in Libya&#x2019;s east, was announced during a meeting between envoys from the council and Nicolas Sarkozy, the French president, in Paris on Thursday.</p>
<p>&#x201C;France has recognised the national transition council as the legitimate representative of the Libyan people,&#x201D; Ali al-Issawi, an envoy from the council said after the talks. The French presidency also issued a similar statement.</p>
<p>Al-Issawi&#xA0;added that the council would &#x201C;open a diplomatic mission, that is our own embassy in Paris, and an ambassador from France will be sent to Benghazi&#x201D;.</p>
<p>&#x201C;This ambassador will be in Benghazi for a transition period before returning to Tripoli.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Libyan state media said the country plans to cut ties with France in response to the announcement, adding a &#x201C;grave secret&#x201D; would prompt the fall of Sarkozy&#x2019;s government.</p>
<p>Khalid Kaim, Libya&#x2019;s deputy foreign minister, said on Thursday that his government may cut diplomatic ties with other countries that backed the rebels against the Gaddafi government.</p>
<p>Ahmed Shabani, a spokesman for the opposition council, told Al Jazeera the move was a &#x201C;major step forward&#x201D;, but that more countries needed to follow suit.</p>
<p><strong>&#x2018;Gaddafi must go&#x2019;<br></strong><br>Tim Friend, Al Jazeera&#x2019;s correspondent in Paris, said the French announcement was a &#x201C;very significant statement of intent which reinforces France&#x2019;s recognition that the Libyan transitional National Council is the legitimate body now representing Libya&#x201D;.</p>
<p>&#x201C;I think France has gone further than anyone else so far in doing that,&#x201D; he said.</p>
<p>Opposition forces set up the National Council in Benghazi on February 27, weeks after a popular revolt against the 40-year rule of Muammar Gaddafi began in the country.</p>
<p>Alain Juppe, the French foreign minister, has also urged&#xA0;partners in the European Union to follow suit and engage with Libyan opposition leaders.</p>
<p>Speaking after talks with Guido Westerwelle, his German counterpart,&#xA0;Juppe said: &#x201C;We are on the same track to say Colonel Gaddafi is discredited, he must go, we must engage dialogue with the new Libyan representatives.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Following the French announcement,&#xA0;Luis Amado, the Portuguese foreign minister, said he had sent a message to Gaddafi saying his regime &#x201C;is over&#x201D;.</p>
<p>&#x201C;The message I sent was that the Gaddafi regime in our view is over, it&#x2019;s legitimacy is over,&#x201D; he said on Thursday.</p>
<p>Germany also announced that it has frozen Libyan government bank accounts held in the country, in line with UN sanctions agreed.&#xA0;Assets belonging to Gaddafi&#x2019;s government have already been frozen in Britain, Canada, the US and Switzerland.</p>
<p><strong>Nato in no-fly zone talks<br></strong><br>Meanwhile, European leaders and defence ministers met at a joint NATO-EU summit on Thursday to discuss possible economic, humanitarian and military responses to the Libyan crisis, including setting up a no-fly zone.</p>
<p>Anders Fogh Rasmussen, the Nato secretary-general, announced that two decisions had been made during the meeting: to increase the presence of NATO maritime assets in the central Mediterranean, and to &#x201C;direct NATO military authorities to begin detailed planning with regard to supporting humanitarian operations, and, subject to further UN decision, more active work to enforce the arms embargo&#x201D;.</p>
<p>On the matter of a no-fly zone, he said that &#x201C;ministers agreed further planning will be required&#x201D;. He said, however, that NATO was &#x201C;united, vigilant and ready to act&#x201D;, but would only do so if it had a &#x201C;clear legal mandate&#x201D; and &#x201C;strong regional support&#x201D;.</p>
<p>EU leaders are set to meet to further discuss the issue on Friday in Brussels.</p>
<p>Shabani, the spokesman for the Libyan opposition council, told Al Jazeera that the &#x201C;legal basis [for an intervention] is clear&#x201D;, and that the UN was &#x201C;really slow at acting upon&#x201D; events and hence NATO action should not be predicated on a UN resolution.</p>
<p>Fidel Castro, Cuba&#x2019;s revolutionary leader, and Evo Morales, the Bolivian president, have issued a statement saying that any NATO military intervention in Libya would only &#x201C;prolong&#x201D; the conflict and would be self-serving.</p>
<p>Diplomats at the UN, meanwhile, said that there was currently a deadlock on whether or not to impose a no-fly zone over Libya, with China and Russia opposed to the move, and Germany preferring a tightening of sanctions.</p>
<p><strong>NATO aircraft surveillance</strong></p>
<p>The AFP news agency reported that Nato aircraft had begun a 24-hour air surveillance of Libya&#x2019;s air space on Thursday, according to an official speaking anonymously.</p>
<p>It and the <em>Le Monde</em> newspaper also quoted a source close to Sarkozy saying that the French president will propose &#x201C;targeted air strikes&#x201D; in Libya to EU leaders.</p>
<p>Al Jazeera&#x2019;s Tim Friend said there had been no independent confirmation of the proposal, but if true it would be likely met with strong resistance from other nations.</p>
<p>EU diplomats said earlier in the day that the body had formally extended its embargo on Libya to include five financial organisations, including the central bank, and a former senior finance official.</p>
<p>And Russia also announced that it was banning weapons sales to Libya, reinforcing a UN embargo. Moscow is the world&#x2019;s second-largest arms exporter after the United States,&#xA0;and was one of the main suppliers of weapons to Libya.</p>
<p>Navi Pillay, the UN human rights chief, meanwhile reiterated her stance that Libya&#x2019;s aerial bombardment of civilians and use of heavy weapons against protesters may amount to &#x201C;crimes against humanity&#x201D;.</p>
<p>Speaking in Geneva on Thursday, she said she had also received reports of executions, rapes and disappearances in the north African country, and that all allegations must be investigated fully.</p>
