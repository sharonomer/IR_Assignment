<p>Former Governor of New Jersey Chris Christie, who has remained a close ally of United States President Donald Trump since the 2016 election, has derided the conduct of the president&#x2019;s legal team as a &#x201C;national embarrassment&#x201D;.</p>
<p>Christie, who has helped Trump prepare for debates throughout the 2016 and 2020 election seasons, said Trump&#x2019;s legal team has made vast claims of fraud in news conferences, but has not backed those up in the courtroom.</p>
<p>Trump has refused to concede defeat in the presidential contest, and has instead focused on long-shot legal challenges and recounts in hopes of overturning the electoral victory of his opponent, Democrat Joe Biden. President-elect Biden currently has 306 electoral votes, well above the 270 electoral votes needed to win under the US Electoral College system.</p>
<p>&#x201C;What&#x2019;s happened here is, quite frankly, the content of the president&#x2019;s legal team has been a national embarrassment,&#x201D; Christie said during a panel appearance on ABC News.</p>

<p>&#x201C;I have been a supporter of the president&#x2019;s. I voted for him twice, but elections have consequences, and we cannot continue to act as if something happened here that didn&#x2019;t happen. You have an obligation to present the evidence,&#x201D; he said.</p>
<p>Christie added that Republicans should be focusing on the two Senate runoff races in Georgia in January, which will decide which party controls the Senate.</p>
<h2>&#x2018;Throwing rocks through windows&#x2019;</h2>
<p>Few high-profile Republicans, and even fewer Trump allies, have acknowledged Biden&#x2019;s victory, with many instead offering tacit or explicit support to Trump&#x2019;s unfounded claims of widespread voting fraud and voting irregularities.</p>
<p>However, in recent days more have broken their silence. Those include Senator Pat Toomey, a Republican from Pennsylvania, who on Saturday urged Trump to accept the results.</p>
<p>&#x201C;To ensure that he is remembered for these outstanding accomplishments, and to help unify our country, President Trump should accept the outcome of the election and facilitate the presidential transition process,&#x201D; Toomey said, earning a quick rebuke from Trump on Twitter.</p>
<p>Other prominent Senators, including Trump ally Lindsey Graham, have said Trump should allow some cooperation with Biden&#x2019;s transition team, while still supporting the president&#x2019;s legal challenges.</p>

<p>On Sunday, North Dakota Senator Kevin Cramer became the most recent conservative to criticise Trump&#x2019;s transition delay. However, he also defended the president&#x2019;s myriad legal challenges.</p>
<p>Trump&#x2019;s former National Security Advisor John Bolton, who fell out with the president and was fired in September of 2019, also had harsh words for the president on Sunday.</p>
<p>In an interview with CNN, Bolton accused Trump of &#x201C;throwing rocks through windows&#x201D; and being &#x201C;the political equivalent of a street rioter&#x201D;.</p>
<p>Bolton added that Trump&#x2019;s challenges were no longer a &#x201C;legal exercise&#x201D;, but had become &#x201C;an exercise of raw political power&#x201D;.</p>
