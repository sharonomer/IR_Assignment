<p>Libyan renegade military commander Khalifa Haftar has backed a ceasefire in Libya to take effect from Monday, Egypt&#x2019;s president announced after talks in Cairo.</p>
<p>The development follows a series of military victories of Libya&#x2019;s UN-recognised Government of National Accord (GNA) against Haftar&#x2019;s forces.</p>
<p>&#x201C;This initiative calls for respecting all international efforts and initiatives by declaring a ceasefire from 6pm [16:00 GMT] Monday, June 8, 2020,&#x201D; President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi told a news conference on Saturday.</p>
<p>He was speaking alongside Haftar and his ally, eastern parliament speaker Aguila Saleh.</p>
<p>El-Sisi urged international support for the initiative and called on the United Nations to invite Libya&#x2019;s rival administrations for talks.</p>
<p>The initiative, called the &#x201C;Cairo declaration&#x201D;, urged the withdrawal of &#x201C;foreign mercenaries from all Libyan territory&#x201D;, he said.</p>
<p>El-Sisi added that the declaration also called for &#x201C;dismantling militias and handing over their weaponry so that Libyan National Army [led by Haftar] would be able to carry out its military and security responsibilities and duties&#x201D;.</p>
<p>The Egyptian president also said the initiative paves the way for forming an elected presidential council in Libya.</p>
<p>He added that it prevents &#x201C;extremist militias&#x201D; from gaining control over the country&#x2019;s resources.</p>
<p>Later on Saturday, Russia announced its support for the ceasefire announced in Egypt</p>
<p>&#x201C;We read the content of the Egyptian President&#x2019;s offer, of course, we support all kinds of offers to stop the conflicts in Libya as soon as possible,&#x201D; said Mikhail Bogdanov, the special representative of Russia to the Middle East and African countries, according to the Ria News Agency.</p>

<h2>Sirte offensive</h2>
<p>Meanwhile, forces loyal to Libya&#x2019;s UN-recognised government said they launched an offensive on Saturday to seize the strategic city of Sirte.</p>
<p>&#x201C;The air force has carried out five strikes in the outskirts of Sirte,&#x201D; slain dictator Moamer Kadhafi&#x2019;s hometown and the last major settlement before the traditional boundary between Libya&#x2019;s west and east, GNA spokesman Mohamad Gnounou said.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Orders have been given to our forces to begin their advance and to systematically attack all rebel positions,&#x201D; he added.</p>
<p>Sirte was taken by Haftar&#x2019;s forces virtually without a fight in January after one of Libya&#x2019;s myriad local fighters switched sides.</p>
<p>Libya plunged into chaos in 2011 when an uprising toppled and later killed longtime leader Muammar Gaddafi.</p>
<p>It is split between two rival administrations in the east and the west, each backed by opposing fighters struggling for power.</p>
<p>Haftar has since last year sought to regain control over the west, fighting the GNA in an abortive attempt to seize the capital Tripoli.</p>

<p class="speakable">The latest development comes a day after the GNA seized the city of Tarhuna,&#xA0;<span>Haftar&#x2019;s last stronghold in northwestern Libya, which</span>&#xA0;was used as the main launchpad against Tripoli.&#xA0;</p>
<p class="speakable"><span>Friday&#x2019;s defeat inflicts serious blows to Haftar&#x2019;s 14-month offensive to capture Tripoli.</span></p>
<p>Haftar is supported by Egypt and the United Arab Emirates as well as Russia.</p>
