<p>Libya has condemned the Egyptian president for recent comments suggesting Cairo &#x201C;will not stand idle&#x201D; against threats to national security and could arm Libyan tribes against the internationally recognised government in Tripoli.</p>
<p>During a meeting in Cairo with tribal leaders from the eastern Libyan city of Benghazi on Thursday, President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi said Egypt &#x201C;will not stand idle in the face of any moves that pose a direct threat to the national security not only of Egypt but also that of Libya&#x201D; and the region, according to a presidency statement.</p>
<p>In response, the Government of National Accord&#x2019;s (GNA) Foreign Ministry spokesperson criticised the statement as &#x201C;blatant interference in Libyan internal affairs&#x201D;.</p>
<p>&#x201C;El-Sisi&#x2019;s talk is a repeat of his previous statements, which is a blatant interference in Libyan affairs,&#x201D; Mohammed al-Qablawi told Al Jazeera,&#xA0;adding that el-Sisi&#x2019;s speech was &#x201C;not aimed at peace, as he said, but it is he who is fueling the [Libyan] conflict.&#x201D;</p>
<p>The Egyptian president&#x2019;s comments came days after the eastern-based Libyan parliament, aligned with renegade commander Khalifa Haftar, gave in-principle support to a threatened Egyptian military intervention in the country.</p>
<p>In June, el-Sisi suggested that Cairo could launch &#x201C;external military missions&#x201D; into Libya, saying &#x201C;any direct intervention in Libya has already become legitimate internationally&#x201D;.</p>
<p>He threatened to send in his army if GNA forces captured Sirte, located more than 800km (500 miles) from the Egyptian border.&#xA0;</p>

<p>Libya, a major oil producer, has been mired in chaos since a 2011 NATO-backed uprising that toppled and killed longtime ruler Muammar Gaddafi.</p>
<p>Since 2014, it has been split between rival factions based in Tripoli and in the east, in a sometimes-chaotic war that has drawn in outside powers and a flood of foreign arms and mercenaries.</p>
