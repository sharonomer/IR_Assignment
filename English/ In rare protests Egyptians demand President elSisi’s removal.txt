<p>Thousands of pro-democracy protesters marched in cities across <a href="/topics/country/egypt.html">Egypt</a>&#xA0;on Friday, demanding the resignation of President <a href="/topics/people/abdel-fattah-el-sisi.html">Abdel Fattah el-Sisi</a>.&#xA0;</p>
<p>Videos posted on social media showed demonstrators chanting &#x201C;rise up, fear not, Sisi must go&#x201D; and &#x201C;the people demand the regime&#x2019;s fall&#x201D; late on Friday.</p>
<p>Protests were reported in the capital Cairo, the second-biggest city of Alexandria and Suez.</p>
<p>Officers in civilian uniforms confronted the demonstrators who tried approaching Cairo&#x2019;s Tahrir Square, where mass protests started in 2011 which toppled <a href="/topics/people/hosni-mubarak.html">Hosni Mubarak</a>.&#xA0;</p>
<p><span><span>Al Jazeera is banned from reporting from inside Egypt, but there were several reports&#xA0;</span>of arrests made in the capital, and tear gas being used on demonstrators.&#xA0; </span></p>
<p>The demonstrations came after self-exiled Egyptian businessman and actor Mohamed Ali accused President el-Sisi of corruption and <a href="/news/2019/09/egyptian-businessman-calls-president-el-sisi-step-190919091741745.html">called on people</a> to take to the streets and demand the leader be removed. El-Sisi has dismissed the allegations as &#x201C;lies&#x201D;.&#xA0;</p>
<p>&#x201C;If el-Sisi does not announce his resignation by Thursday, then the Egyptian people will come out to the squares on Friday in protest,&#x201D; Ali said in a video posted on Tuesday.</p>

</p><p><em><strong>Translation: &#x201C;Rise up, fear not, Sisi must go&#x201D;</strong></em></p>
<p>Ali first began posting his videos&#xA0;on September 2. His latest videos have been viewed hundreds of thousands of times and have turned him into a public figure in his homeland.</p>
<p>In a video on Friday that was published as protests were gaining momentum, Ali encouraged people to stand strong and continue demanding their rights.&#xA0;</p>
<p>&#x201C;God is great &#x2026; enough already, I want to come back to Egypt. I miss Egypt and my people. May God strengthen your resolve,&#x201D; he said.&#xA0;</p>

<p>Yehia Ghanem, Al Jazeera&#x2019;s Middle East analyst, said he &#x201C;definitely&#x201D; believes Friday&#x2019;s protests represent a different level of momentum among Egyptians.&#xA0;</p>
<p>&#x201C;What is happening in Egypt now is a long overdue movement &#x2026; to rid the country from tyranny,&#x201D; he said.&#xA0;</p>

<p>Friday&#x2019;s protests were a rare public display of dissent in the country. Egypt outlawed all unauthorised demonstrations in 2013 after el-Sisi, as defence minister, led the military&#x2019;s overthrow of democratically-elected President <a href="/topics/people/mohamed-morsi.html">Mohamed Morsi</a> following mass protests.&#xA0;</p>
<p>A pro-government TV anchor said only a small group of protesters had gathered in central Cairo to take videos and selfies before leaving the scene. Another pro-government channel said the situation around Tahrir Square was quiet.</p>
<p>Since el-Sisi came to power, economic austerity measures have been introduced, helping to reboot an economy battered by the 2011 Arab Spring. But the poverty rate has soared.</p>
<p>According to official statistics, released in July, one in three Egyptians lives in poverty.</p>
<p>Human Rights Watch has&#xA0;<a href="https://www.hrw.org/world-report/2019/country-chapters/egypt" target="_blank">said</a>&#xA0;that&#xA0;since el-Sisi secured a second term in 2018, &#x201C;his security forces have escalated a campaign of intimidation, violence, and arbitrary arrests against political opponents, activists.&#x201D;</p>
<p>United Nations experts have previously&#xA0;<a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=22008&amp;LangID=E" target="_blank">stated</a>&#xA0;their &#x201C;grave concern&#x201D; over a widening &#x201C;<a href="/news/2017/08/condemns-egypt-widening-assault-free-speech-170830162850516.html">assault on freedom of expression</a>&#x201D; in Egypt, which includes blocking scores of news websites and the unlawful detention of journalists and dissidents.</p>
<p>Dalia Fahmy, an associate professor at Long Island University and a senior fellow at the Center for Global Policy in Washington, DC, said Friday&#x2019;s protests were very different from the ones in 2011.</p>
<p>Fahmy said it was surprising to see people break the fear barrier, but added that this was to be expected.</p>
<p>&#x201C;If we look at the population today, of a hundred million people the average age is 23. Now if you subtract eight which was when the revolution happened, it means the average age was 15,&#x201D; she said.</p>
<p>&#x201C;When you have much of the population that doesn&#x2019;t live with the post-revolution trauma or memories, you have a group of young people coming in with a different set of demands and different kinds of understanding of a future possibility. So those on the streets today are very different from the ones that were there eight years ago.&#x201D;</p>
