<p>Supporters and opponents of Egypt&#x2019;s president have clashed in several cities after he assumed sweeping new powers, a clear show of the deepening polarisation plaguing the country.</p>
<p>In the largest&#xA0;rally on Friday, thousands of chanting protesters packed Cairo&#x2019;s Tahrir Square, the heart of the 2011 revolution, demanding Mohamed Morsi quit and accusing him of launching a &#x201C;coup&#x201D;.</p>
<p>Buoyed by accolades from around the world for mediating a truce between Hamas and Israel, Morsi on Thursday issued a declaration giving himself powers that go beyond those held by toppled president Hosni Mubarak, putting himself above the judiciary.</p>
<p>He also ordered that an Islamist-dominated assembly writing the new constitution could not be dissolved by legal challenges.</p>
<p>Liberal and secular members earlier walked out of the body, charging it would impose strict Islamic practices.</p>
<p>&#x201C;I am for all Egyptians. I will not be biased against any son of Egypt,&#x201D; Morsi said on a stage outside the presidential palace on Friday, adding that he was working for social and economic stability and the rotation of power.</p>
<p><strong>Tear gas fired</strong></p>
<p>Thousands of protesters gathered in Tahrir Square after&#xA0; opposition leaders called for a &#x201C;million-man march&#x201D; to protest against what they say is a coup by Morsi.&#xA0;</p>

<p>Al Jazeera Hoda Abdel-Hamid, reporting from Cairo, said that while the crowds had thinned slightly, there were still many people in Tahrir Square, &#x201C;calling for the fall of the regime &#x2013; the are calling for the fall of the [Muslim] Brotherhood&#x201D;.</p>
<p>Protests also turned violent in Alexandria, Port Said and Suez.</p>
<p>Fifteen people were injured in clashes between supporters and opponents of the president.</p>
<p>The headquarters of Morsi&#x2019;s Freedom and Justice Party headquarters in Alexandria was set on fire by protesters on Friday afternoon.</p>
<p>The party&#x2019;s offices have been attacked in five cities in total.</p>
<p><strong>&#x2018;We are all together&#x2019;</strong></p>
<p>Hundreds of Morsi&#x2019;s supporters rallied outside the presidential palace in Cairo on Friday to express support for the him.</p>
<p>In his speech, Morsi&#xA0;said: &#x201C;I will never be against any Egyptians because we are all together and we need to give momentum to freedom and democracy and the transfer.</p>
<p>&#x201C;I like to support what you want &#x2013; to have stability and safety, the safety of the individual and safety of the nation.&#x201D;</p>
<p>He said he&#xA0;aimed to bring social and economic stability to Egypt. Doing so, he said requires &#x201C;getting rid of the obstacles of the past&#x201D;.</p>
<p>&#x201C;My decision is to keep and to maintain and to preserve the nation and the people,&#x201D; Morsi said.</p>
<p>&#x201C;I don&#x2019;t want to have all the powers&#x2026;but if I see my nation in danger, I will do and I will act. I must.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Morsi, an Islamist whose roots are in the Muslim Brotherhood, has also given himself sweeping powers that allowed him to sack the unpopular prosecutor general and opened the door for a retrial for Mubarak and his aides.</p>
<p>The president&#x2019;s decree aimed to end the logjam and push Egypt, the Arab world&#x2019;s most populous nation, more quickly on its democratic path, the presidential spokesman said.</p>
<p>&#x201C;President Morsi said we must go out of the bottleneck without breaking the bottle,&#x201D; Yasser Ali told Reuters.</p>
<p>Our corresponded, Hoda Abdel-Hamid, said that many of Morsi&#x2019;s supporters had been &#x201C;bussed in from different parts of the country,&#x201D; adding that the crowd protesting Morsi&#x2019;s decree were angered by his speech.</p>
<p>&#x201C;President Morsi appeared today, he said that he was speaking to all Egyptians&#x2026;but he spoke on a stage to his own constituency in front of the presidential palace,&#x201D; said Abdel-Hamid.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Many people here will tell you that if he&#x2019;s a president to all Egyptians, he should have spoke to the nation from his own office, but certainly not to his constituency.&#x201D;</p>
<p><strong>&#x2018;Huge ramifications&#x2019;</strong></p>
<p>Morsi&#x2019;s decree raises very serious human rights concerns, a spokesperson for the UN Human Rights Commissioner Navi Pillay said on Friday.</p>
<p>&#x201C;We are very concerned about the possible huge ramifications of this declaration on human rights and the rule of law in Egypt,&#x201D; Rupert Colville said at the UN in Geneva.</p>
<p>&#x201C;We also fear this could lead to a very volatile situation over the next few days, starting today in fact.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Hassan Nafaa, professor of political science at Cairo University, told Al Jazeera that Morsi &#x201C;is erecting himself as an absolute monarch&#x201D; because he did not consult the opposition on the decision.</p>
<p>&#x201C;The problem is not about the content of the decisions itself, but about the way it was taken,&#x201D; he said.</p>
<p>&#x201C;This is a dangerous situation for the whole country. It is very confusing, because we don&#x2019;t know if we are in the presence of a constitutional declaration, or of a law, or of just administrative degrees,&#x201D; said Nafaa.</p>
<p>&#x201C;We have all of this together in the same statement.&#x201D;</p>
