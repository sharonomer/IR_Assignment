<p>A court has ordered the release of the two sons of former Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, taking into account they have completed their three-year sentences on corruption convictions.</p>
<p>The brothers are expected to walk free later today or tomorrow after the Cairo Criminal Court announced its verdict in the multimillion-dollar embezzlement case&#xA0;on Monday.</p>
<p>Alaa and Gamal Mubarak were convicted of embezzling state funds allocated for the renovation of Egypt&#x2019;s presidential palaces.&#xA0;</p>
<p>The brothers still face trial on insider trading charges, however, with the next hearing due October 17.</p>
<p>Their release is likely to present a dilemma for President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, a former army chief whom opponents accuse of reviving Mubarak-era autocratic practises.</p>
<p>Sisi took power after ousting the country&#x2019;s first democratically elected President Mohamed Morsi in 2013 and won a landslide victory in last&#xA0;year&#x2019;s presidential election.</p>
<p><strong>Economic crimes</strong></p>
<p>&#x201C;The perception is that those who were responsible for major economic crimes and human rights violations under Mubarak&#x2019;s dictatorship are being slapped on the hand,&#x201D; said Sahar Aziz, professor of law at Texas A&amp;M School of Law, speaking to Al Jazeera, &#x201C;whereas those who attempted to overthrow the regime &#x2026; are being heavily penalised.</p>
<p>&#x201C;The Egyptian revolution is yet to come, hopefully, it will be a nonviolent revolution. The Egyptian people&#x2019;s hope to have a democratic state is yet to be realised.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Former President Mubarak, who ruled Egypt for 30 years, was convicted in the same case, in which the trio was charged with spending more than 100 million Egyptian pounds ($12.8m) of state money on their private residences.</p>
<p>Mubarak was ousted from power in February 2011, after 18 days of nationwide protests demanding his removal. Two months later, his sons were detained.</p>
<p>The brothers were released in January this year after the initial verdict was overturned. They were jailed again after the conviction was reinstated on retrial in May.</p>
<p>Hosni Mubarak was ordered to be released as he had already spent three years in pre-trial detention. He still faces a final trial on charges of responsibility for the killings of demonstrators during the 2011 uprising.</p>
