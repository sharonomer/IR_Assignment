<p>Talaat Sadat, who was also convicted of spreading disinformation, was taken into custody immediately after the verdict was announced on Tuesday, his brother Mohammed-Anwar Sadat said.</p>
<p>He was also fined 200 Egyptian pounds ($35).</p>
<p>Sadat, an opposition politician, was put on trial for&#xA0;saying that&#xA0;the 1981 assassination of President Sadat was an international conspiracy in which senior Egyptian military officials at the time were involved.</p>
<p>An Islamist militant shot the former president dead as he watched a military parade.</p>
<p>The gunman was tried and executed.</p>
<p>&#x201C;We do not know what to do now &#x2026; The verdict was a surprise to all of his lawyers,&#x201D; the legislator&#x2019;s brother told Reuters.</p>
<p><strong>No appeal</strong></p>
<p>There is usually no appeal against emergency military court verdicts, although convicts can ask President Hosni Mubarak for a pardon.</p>

<p>Egypt&#x2019;s parliament speaker agreed to strip Talaat Sadat&#x2019;s parliamentary immunity after a request from military prosecutors earlier this month following his remarks about Sadat&#x2019;s assassination.</p>
<p>Sadat has said his comments were not intended to insult the military establishment, and later published newspaper advertisements professing respect for the army.</p>
<p>Several Egyptian human rights organisations have said the decision to put Sadat on trial before a military court was a violation of the right to free speech.</p>
<p>Sadat is a member of the small opposition party, Al-Ahrar.</p>
