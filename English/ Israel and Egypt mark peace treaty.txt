<p>However, she also recognised the limits of the historic deal made by Menachem Begin, the Israeli prime minister, and Anwar Sadat, the Egyptian president.&#xA0;</p>
<p>&#x201C;There is still a lot to be explored and accomplished in our relations, above all the desire of the Israeli public to witness the opening up of the great Egyptian people toward us,&#x201D;&#xA0;Livni said.</p>
<p><strong>Palestinian tragedy</strong></p>
<p>Reda, who says he considered boycotting the reception over Israel&#x2019;s planned appointment of Avigdor Lieberman as the next foreign minister,&#xA0;said that wider peace across the Middle East was predicated on a just deal for the Palestinians.</p>

<p>&#x201C;The tragedy of the Palestinian people is a permanent source of crisis,&#x201D;&#xA0;he said as he addressed a conference at Jerusalem&#x2019;s Hebrew University earlier in the day.</p>
<p>Reda called on Israel to embrace a a proposal by the 23-member Arab League offering comprehensive peace in exchange for accepting an independent Palestinian state on all lands captured in the 1967 Middle East war.</p>
<p>&#x201C;It should be clear that this would serve to enable the Palestinians to secure their legitimate rights and would be in Israel&#x2019;s interests as well,&#x201D; he said.</p>
<p>However, Reda&#xA0;also warned that&#xA0;Jewish&#xA0;settlement expansion in the West Bank&#xA0;threatened a lasting two-state solution and said that &#x201C;certain regional powers&#x201D; and armed groups have taken advantage of the Palestinian crisis.</p>
<p>The two countries&#x2019; militaries meet regularly to co-ordinate defense issues, such as the long, largely unfenced shared desert border as well as the Gaza Strip&#x2019;s frontier with Egypt.</p>
<p>There are joint committees on economics and agriculture, and thousands of Egyptians have&#xA0;travelled to Israel for agricultural training, according to the Israeli foreign ministry.</p>
<p>However, Israeli tourists are advised against travel to Egypt&#xA0;by their government fearing that they could be attacked, while economic and cultural ties are few.</p>
<p>Many Egyptians with professional relations with Israel hide the fact.</p>
<p><strong>Financial windfall</strong></p>
<p>Egypt is not expected to hold any events to formally marking the signing of the treaty, a fact lamented by Israel&#x2019;s ambassador in&#xA0;Cairo.</p>

<p>&#x201C;It needs to reach people&#x2019;s hearts and that&#x2019;s what&#x2019;s missing,&#x201D; Shlomo Cohen told Israel Radio.<strong><br></strong><br>Cairo also benefited from the deal with&#xA0;billions of dollars in US aid.</p>
<p>James Cunningham, the US ambassador to Israel, told Wednesday&#x2019;s&#xA0;conference in Jerusalem that the US government remained committed to working towards a comprehensive peace deal between Israel and Arab nations.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Peace between Israel and it&#x2019;s neighbours and the pursuit of genuine stability and security for all in this region, have since Camp David remained a central preoccupation of successive US administrations, and that will remain the case with president Obama,&#x201D; he said.</p>
<p>&#x201C;The United States remains committed to the two state solution, which we see as instrumental to ending this conflict.&#x201D;</p>
