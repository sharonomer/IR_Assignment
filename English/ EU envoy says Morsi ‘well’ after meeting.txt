<p>Catherine Ashton, the European Union foreign policy chief, said Egypt&#x2019;s deposed president Mohamed Morsi was &#x201C;well&#x201D; after meeting him for two hours, his first known contact with the outside world since&#xA0;he was&#xA0;toppled by the army&#xA0;earlier this month.</p>
<p>In a press conference on Tuesday, Ashton said Morsi &#x201C;has access to information, in terms of TV, newspapers, so we were able to talk about the situation&#x201D;.</p>
<p>She refused to comment on the substance of their conversation, saying&#xA0;&#x201C;I told him that I was not going to represent his views&#x201D;.</p>
<p>Morsi has been held incommunicado since the military had removed him from power on July 3. Early on Wednesday, the state news agency confirmed that a delegation led by former Malian President Alfa Omar Konari also held a one-hour long meeting with the deposed president.</p>
<p>Egypt&#x2019;s authorities say Morsi is being investigated for charges including murder, stemming from a 2011 jailbreak when he escaped detention during the revolution that toppled longtime president Hosni Mubarak.</p>
<p>Later on Tuesday, speaking alongside interim vice president Mohamed El Baradei, Ashton said EU diplomats would be in Egypt to continue efforts to mediate an end to the crisis.</p>
<p>&#x201C;I will come back,&#x201D; she said, adding it was up to&#xA0;Egyptian politicians to &#x201C;make the right decisions&#x201D;.</p>
<p>El Baradei said he was optimistic sit-ins by the Muslim&#xA0;Brotherhood, which is protesting against the army&#x2019;s overthrow of&#xA0;President Mohamed Morsi could be ended peacefully.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Once we&#xA0;contain the violence that is taking place, then there will be&#xA0;room for a peaceful way to disband the demonstrations in&#xA0;different parts of the country and go into a serious dialogue,&#x201D;&#xA0;he said.</p>
<p>The political turmoil has divided Egypt, with hundreds of thousands&#xA0;taking to the streets in&#xA0;rival rallies for and against military rule. Tension increased further after&#xA0;scores were killed at a rally in support of&#xA0;Morsi&#xA0;in Cairo on Saturday.</p>
<p><strong>Protesters warned</strong></p>
<p>Monday&#x2019;s meeting with Ashton&#xA0;came as Morsi&#x2019;s supporters marched towards security headquarters in Cairo,&#xA0;despite a warning from the National Defence Council&#xA0;that it would take &#x201C;decisive and firm action&#x201D; against demonstrators if they went beyond their right to peaceful protest.</p>
<p>The marches began after supporters of&#xA0;Morsi broke their Ramadan fast. Groups moved from their key sit-in site by the Rabaa al-Adawiya mosque in Cairo towards the interior ministry and two other security forces buildings.</p>
<p>Thousands of demonstrators, men and women, chanted slogans against army chief General Abdel Fattah El Sisi.</p>
<p>Earlier, the Anti-Coup Alliance of groups protesting against Morsi&#x2019;s&#xA0;removal also called for a massive turnout for demonstrations on Tuesday.</p>
<p>They urged Egyptians &#x201C;to go out into the streets and squares, to regain their freedom and dignity &#x2013; that are being usurped by the bloody coup &#x2013; and for the rights of the martyrs assassinated by its bullets&#x201D;.</p>
<p>Ashton also met El Sisi, interim president, Adly Mansour, and representatives of the pro-Morsi coalition.&#xA0;</p>
<p>&#x201C;There were no initiatives presented by Ashton or us, she just heard updates on the situation since her last visit,&#x201D; said Mohamed Ali Bishr, a pro-Morsi delegation member.</p>
<p>The bloodshed in the Arab world&#x2019;s most populous nation has&#xA0;caused mounting international concern, and Washington on Monday &#x201C;strongly&#x201D; condemned the violence.</p>
<p>A group of Egyptian NGOs issued a statement on Monday calling for the Interior Minister Mohamed Ibrahim to be sacked for what it called Saturday&#x2019;s &#x201C;massacre&#x201D;.</p>
<p>A crackdown on Morsi supporters continued on Monday, with the arrest of the president and vice president of the moderate Islamist Wasat party, which has protested against Morsi&#x2019;s removal.</p>
