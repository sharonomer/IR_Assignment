<p>More world leaders have congratulated United States President-elect Joe Biden than have Republican politicians in the United States.</p>
<p>Major US allies Canada, the United Kingdom, France and Germany were quick to recognise Biden&#x2019;s victory and to extend congratulations. Ireland, too.</p>
<p>Indeed, the world is moving forward to work with the new president-elect even as President Donald Trump refuses to concede and seeks ways to undo the election in court.</p>
<p>Biden was declared the winner by US media organisations tracking returns on November 7 after he appeared to win enough states to garner a majority of the US Electoral College.</p>
<p>Biden spoke with the leaders of Australia, Japan and South Korea on Wednesday evening, Biden&#x2019;s transition team said in a statement.</p>
<p>Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison discussed the challenge of containing the coronavirus and laying the groundwork for a global economic recovering, the Biden team said in a read-out of the calls.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga of Japan offered Biden his congratulations and Biden complimented Suga for his steady leadership during the recent governing transition in Japan.</p>
<p>Speaking with President Moon Jae-in of South Korea, Biden praised Korea&#x2019;s leadership in addressing the pandemic and said he looked forward to working with Moon on the challenge of North Korea.</p>

The State Department traditionally has coordinated international contacts between incoming presidents and foreign heads of state.<p></p>
<p>Nations whose leaders had warm relationships with Trump have been slower to acknowledge Biden&#x2019;s victory while the president still refuses to concede. The leaders of Russia, Brazil, Mexico, China and North Korea have yet to congratulate Biden.</p>

Only four Senate Republicans have recognised Biden as the winner and offered congratulations.<p></p>
<p>Former 2012 presidential nominee, Senator Mitt Romney was the first high-profile Republican to extend congratulations to Biden within hours of the race being called by the AP.</p>
<p>Romney said in a tweet that he and his wife Ann congratulated Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris.</p>
<p>&#x201C;We know both of them as people of good will and admirable character,&#x201D; Romney said. &#x201C;We pray that God may bless them in the days and years ahead.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Senator Ben Sasse of Nebraska offered his congratulations to Biden in a statement. &#x201C;I congratulate the next president, Joe Biden, and the next vice president, Kamala Harris,&#x201D; Sasse said.</p>
<p>Notably, former President George W Bush gave his imprimatur to Biden&#x2019;s victory with a congratulatory phone call on November 8.</p>
<p>&#x201C;I just talked to the President-elect of the United States, Joe Biden. I extended my warm congratulations and thanked him for the patriotic message he delivered&#x201D; in his victory speech, Bush said in a statement.</p>
<p>Maine Senator Susan Collins issued a statement on November 9, offering Biden congratulations on his &#x201C;apparent victory&#x201D;.</p>
<p>Several Republican members of the House of Representatives and Republican governors also offered congratulations. But they were exceptions. Most Republican officeholders have followed Trump&#x2019;s lead in refusing to acknowledge Biden&#x2019;s win.</p>
<p>Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said in a speech Trump should have an opportunity to challenge the outcome of the election and that process must be allowed to play out.</p>
<p>&#x201C;The projections and commentary of the press do not get veto power over the legal rights of any citizen, including the president,&#x201D; McConnell said.</p>
<p>Some Republicans, like Senator Lindsey Graham, who won re-election in South Carolina, are actively trying to undermine the legitimacy of Biden&#x2019;s win. Graham said he would donate $500,000 in money from his political action fund to Trump&#x2019;s legal efforts to overturn Biden&#x2019;s victory.</p>
<p>Asked about the Trump administration&#x2019;s failure to cooperate with Biden&#x2019;s transition team, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said at a news conference on November 10 there would be a &#x201C;smooth transition&#x201D;, but to another four-year Trump administration.</p>
