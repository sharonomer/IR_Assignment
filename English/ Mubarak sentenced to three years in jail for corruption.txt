<p>An Egyptian court has sentenced ousted president Hosni Mubarak and his two sons to three years in prison for embezzlement.</p>
<p>Mubarak and his sons Alaa and Gamal were present in the caged dock on Saturday, wearing&#xA0;suits and sunglasses.</p>
<p>They had already been sentenced to three years on the same charges but an appeal court overturned the verdict and ordered a retrial.</p>
<p>The trio were also fined $16m.</p>
<p>Mubarak&#x2019;s lawyers may try to appeal the verdict, the AFP news agency reported.</p>
<p>Supporters shouted in anger as Judge Hassan Hassanin announced his verdict and it was not immediately clear whether it will include time he has already served since his country&#x2019;s 2011 revolt.</p>
<p>Some of those backing Mubarak wore T-shirts emblazoned with the former leader&#x2019;s face. They waved and blew kisses as the 87-year-old entered the courtroom, according to the Associated Press.</p>
<p>Omar Ashour, a lecturer in Arab and Islamic Studies at the University of Exeter, told Al Jazeera the sentencing would be seen as &#x201C;nothing&#x201D; by Egyptians who protested to end Mubarak&#x2019;s rule.</p>
<p>&#x201C;When we see the series of brutal abuses that happened under Mubarak in his 30-year reign, it will be seen as nothing, especially when we look at the trial happening now of former president Mohamed Morsi,&#x201D; he said.</p>
<p>&#x201C;It tells you that there is very high politicisation of the judiciary.&#x201D;</p>
<p>The corruption case, dubbed by the Egyptian media as the &#x201C;presidential palaces&#x201D; affair, concerns charges that Mubarak and his two sons embezzled millions of dollars worth of state funds over the course of a decade.</p>
<p>The funds were meant to pay for renovating and maintaining presidential palaces but were instead allegedly spent on upgrading the family&#x2019;s private residences.</p>
<p>Mubarak was sentenced to three years, his sons to four in the case, prior to having the verdicts overturned.</p>
<p>The hearing, at a police academy on the outskirts of Cairo, took place in the same courtroom where Egypt&#x2019;s first freely elected president, Morsi, was sentenced to 20 years in prison last month.&#xA0;</p>
