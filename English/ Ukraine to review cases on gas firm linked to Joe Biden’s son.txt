<p>Ukraine&#x2019;s prosecutor-general said on Friday that his office is reviewing several cases related to the owner of a gas company where former Vice President Joe Biden&#x2019;s son sat on the board, as part of a review of all the criminal cases closed by his predecessors.</p>
<p>US President&#xA0;<a href="/topics/people/donald-trump.html">Donald Trump</a><span>&#xA0;</span> had pressed for such a review in a phone call with&#xA0;<span>Ukrainian President&#xA0;</span><a href="/news/2019/04/profile-volodymyr-zelensky-190418131155087.html">Volodymyr Zelensky</a>, a &#x201C;favour&#x201D; that has now led the US Congress to begin an <a href="/topics/events/190926061142695.html">impeachment inquiry</a>.</p>
<p>Prosecutor-General Ruslan Ryaboshapka told reporters his office would revisit about 15 cases, but stressed that they were not necessarily connected to Biden&#x2019;s son, Hunter, who was hired by the oil company, <span>Burisma,&#xA0;</span>in 2014 at the same time his father was leading the Obama administration&#x2019;s diplomatic dealings in Kiev.&#xA0;</p>
<p>Though the timing of Hunter Biden&#x2019;s hiring raised concerns among anti-corruption advocates, there has been no evidence of wrongdoing by either the former vice president or his son.</p>
<p>&#x201C;We are conducting an audit of the cases that were earlier overseen by the Prosecutor-General&#x2019;s Office,&#x201D; said Ryaboshapka, who was appointed in August.</p>
<p>&#x201C;We are reviewing all cases that were closed or broken up into separate cases, to make a decision on whether this was illegal.&#x201D;&#xA0;</p>

<p>Ukrainian authorities have previously said the investigation into Burisma focuses on a period before Hunter Biden joined the company&#x2019;s board.</p>
<p>Ryaboshapka also suggested the prosecutors may focus not on Hunter Biden but on Burisma&#x2019;s founder Mykola Zlochevsky and other figures.</p>
<p>&#x201C;As far as we can see, this is more a question of Zlochevsky and [Ukrainian businessman Sergei] Kurchenko than Burisma and Biden,&#x201D; he said.</p>
<p>Ryaboshapka said he was not aware of any evidence of wrongdoing by Hunter Biden.&#xA0;</p>
<p><span>Burisma says it is the largest private producer of natural gas and one of Ukraine&#x2019;s leading gas groups.</span></p>

<p>Ryaboshapka&#x2019;s announcement came a day after US House investigators released a cache of text messages provided by Kurt Volker, the former special US envoy to Ukraine who stepped down amid the Democrats&#x2019; impeachment inquiry.&#xA0;</p>

<p>Volker in the messages encouraged Zelensky&#x2019;s aide to conduct an investigation linked to Biden&#x2019;s family in return for a high-profile visit to Washington, DC, with President Donald Trump.</p>
<p>Ryaboshapka was mentioned in the July 25 call between Trump and Zelensky, who assured Trump that Ryaboshapka was &#x201C;his man&#x201D; and that he would resume investigations into Burisma.</p>
<p>The prosecutor-general insisted on Friday that he did not feel any pressure over the Burisma case.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Not a single foreign or Ukrainian official or politician has called me or tried to influence my decisions regarding specific criminal cases,&#x201D; he said.</p>
<p>Trump has maintained he has done nothing wrong and has described the impeachment inquiry as &#x201C;crap&#x201D;.&#xA0;</p>
<p>The US president on Thursday again <a href="/news/2019/10/trump-seeks-foreign-probe-bidens-calls-china-191003153955672.html">invited foreign interference</a> in a US presidential election by publicly calling on China to investigate Joe Biden despite there being no evidence of wrongdoing. Democrats called Trump&#x2019;s remarks a &#x201C;fundamental breach of his oath of office&#x201D;.&#xA0;</p>
