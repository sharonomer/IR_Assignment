<p>US Democratic presidential contender Bernie Sanders has won nominating contests in Alaska, Washington and Hawaii, chipping away at frontrunner Hillary Clinton&#x2019;s lead in the race to pick the party&#x2019;s candidate for the White House.</p>
<p>Sanders&#x2019; wins on Saturday underscored Clinton&#x2019;s vulnerabilities within her own party, particularly with young voters and liberal activists who have been inspired by her rival&#x2019;s left-of-centre message.</p>
<p>In an interview with the Associated Press news agency, Sanders cast his performance as part of a Western comeback, saying he expected to close the delegate gap with Clinton as the contest moved to the more liberal northeastern states, including her home state of New York.</p>
<p>He also said that his campaign was increasing its outreach to superdelegates, the party insiders who can pick either candidate, and who are overwhelmingly with Clinton.</p>
<p>&#x201C;The Deep South is a very conservative part of the country,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;Now that we&#x2019;re heading into a progressive part of the country, we expect to do much better.&#x201D;</p>
<p>He added: &#x201C;There is a path to victory.&#x201D; With Clinton far in front, however, it is a difficult path.</p>
<p><strong>Clinton eyes New York</strong></p>
<p>Clinton anticipated the losses. She barely campaigned in the three Western states, making one day of stops in Washington state.</p>

<p>She is turning her focus to the April 19 contest in New York, seeking to win a large share of the delegates at stake and to avoid the blow of losing to Sanders in a state she represented in the Senate.</p>
<p>She is trying to lock up an even larger share of delegates in five northeastern state contests a week later, hoping to deliver a big enough haul to unify the Democratic Party and relegate Sanders to little more than a protest candidate.</p>
<p>Sanders, who has found some success in the industrial Midwest, wants to leverage his arguments against free trade and his working-class support into an April 5 victory in delegate-rich Wisconsin.</p>
<p>He also plans to compete fiercely in New York and is pushing for the party to schedule a debate in the state, saying it would be &#x201C;really absurd&#x201D; if one did not take place.</p>
<p><strong>&#x2018;We&#x2019;re going to win&#x2019;</strong></p>
<p>On Saturday, he told more than 8,000 cheering supporters at a rally in Madison, Wisconsin, that his campaign had momentum, citing Saturday&#x2019;s wins that followed <a class="internallink" href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/03/bernie-sanders-wins-democrats-primary-160321213821907.html" target="_blank">recent victories in Utah and Idaho</a>.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Don&#x2019;t let anybody tell you we can&#x2019;t win the nomination or we can&#x2019;t win the general election. We&#x2019;re going to do both of those things.&#x201D;</p>

<p>After Sanders&#x2019; two wins in Alaska and Washington on Saturday, Clinton held a delegate lead of 1,234 to 956 over Sanders, according to an Associated Press analysis, an advantage that expands to 1,703-985 once the superdelegates are included.</p>
<p>It takes 2,383 delegates to win the nomination at the party&#x2019;s national convention in July in Philadelphia.</p>
<p>Based on the AP count, Sanders still needs to win more than 57 percent of the remaining delegates from primaries and caucuses to have a majority of those delegates by the end of June.</p>
<p>His bar is even higher when the party officials are considered. He needs to win more than 67 percent of the remaining delegates overall &#x2013; from primaries, caucuses and the ranks of uncommitted superdelegates &#x2013; to prevail.</p>
